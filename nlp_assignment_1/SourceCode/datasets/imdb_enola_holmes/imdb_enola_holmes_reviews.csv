jesamazinghawley,"""Perfect for a 15 yro girl""",25 September 2020,"""This is the movie I wish I had at 15. This isn't about Sherlock Holmes. It's not about solving a mystery or surprising the audience. It's about a teenage girl finding out who she is. It was charming, funny, wonderfully acted, aesthetically pleasing, and sweet. If you are a grown man criticizing it, Back off. This wasn't made for you. Or me. This was made for 15 yro girls. And the fifteen year old girl in me LOVED it.""",8
faolanredwolf,"""Not for Sherlock Holmes fans, but not bad either.""",24 September 2020,"""Enola Holmes is absolutely wonderful, quirky and charming. You'll absolutely love it, unless you're a Sherlock Holmes fan, then it quickly looses its charms. They basically change every character completely to fit the story, rendering them unrecognisable. But, it's made for young teen girls and they will love it. I should also add, that Henry Cavill is one of the worst Sherlock Holmes, I've ever seen. I genuinely like him as an actor, but in this case I think he was terribly miscast.If you love Sherlock Holmes, you won't love this... but if you don't care about Holmes you'll have a great time.""",6
korpake,"""It could have been so much more...""",23 September 2020,"""Interesting premise, interesting setting, good actors, terrible writing.
The plot is all over the place.The main character verges on being a ""perfect, but boring"" character. Why are male characters belittled in order to elevate the female ones? Just write them all better instead of doing it this lazy way.Events happen in ways that dont make sense and for no reason other than that the plot demands it.I know this isn't a historical drama and I'm ok to suspend disbelief with a bit of artistic license, but the historical inaccuracies going on are so glaring it removes the viewer from the story entirely. It is made so much worse by sticking ""modern-acting"" characters in a society where such acts would be so out of place.Nothing wrong with a theme of feminism, but it is poor writing to shove the theme in our face every minute. The theme should speak through the actions of the characters, not them telling it to your face while looking at the camera.""",5
zekehardrock,"""Am I the only man who love this movie?""",23 September 2020,"""Mille Bobby Brown is excellent, Sam Claflin is extraordinary and Henry Cavil is being Henry Cavil. The Production is great, the story is heart warming but the mystery is not to much.

Jiu-Jitsu classes for males, females and children were held in England and Europe. Mr. and Mrs Garrud Garrud, trained by a Japanese master, ran his dojo after he went back to Japan (1908?). Mrs. Garrud ran the Suffragette Self-Defense Club, her and the club have quite the story (worth a rabbit hole dive).""",6
sullybolly,"""A Bit Lost""",23 September 2020,"""It sort of tries to be too many things at once.You think it's going to puzzle your brain a lot based on how things are set up, but it doesn't.There're commentaries on oppression and class/privilege differences thrown in there, which were alright, but sometimes annoying.There's a little love story thrown in there too, which is kind of unnecessary. It does get woven into the story and messages, but it's a bit hit and miss.Conceptually good, and well acted. But the execution needs some work.""",5
rhydll,"""Enola Holmes, a fantastic film.""",23 September 2020,"""I've seen many people have disliked the film because of ""historical inaccuracies"" and it's feminist ideas. I must respectfully say, as much as I respect your opinions, you've missed the point of the film entirely.Enola Holmes was not intended to be a masterpiece by Scorsese/Tarantino/James Cameron/Peter Jackson/Spielberg/Nolan et cetera et cetera and leave you with a powerful message or a million questions. This is supposed to be a fun family action/mystery for people of all ages to enjoy, with a hint of that familiar character that is the iconic detective of Baker Street. The film succeeded in its aims to be fun, a film to watch with others to unwind after a long day and forget about life. This film, along with a great story and stellar cast led by the always spectacular Miss Millie Bobby Brown, is exactly what this world needs at this moment in time.The aforementioned cast did brilliantly in their roles. MiIlie Bobby Brown pulls the character off excellently, managing to be a perfect blend of Sherlock and a regular teenage girl, creating a fantastic original character. Cavill and Claflin were exceedingly good (and at some points rather humorous) in their roles of the Holmes brothers and Helena Bonham Carter brings her usual brilliance to the table in her role. The film itself is fantastic, managing to entertain whilst working in the underlying subplot and message of women's rights.I'd highly suggest watching this film and if my argument hasn't persuaded you, let me ask you this; why do we go to the cinema but to be entertained?""",9

It's a stunning, beautiful movie for those forgotten women in the last century.

Also, a very good adventure movie to watch in family .""",8
pranayjalvi,"""Millie Bobby Brown solves a dull mystery in Netflix's disappointing Enola Holmes""",23 September 2020,"""Without much of a mystery to solve, this young Holmes comes across more like a junior-level Wonder Woman: intelligent and highly trained yet puzzled by this unfamiliar, unfair world of men.The movie was less intriguing with no high level mystery whatsoever. It didn't seem as a whole, rather was scattered into bits and pieces which made it kind of dull. A-List cast but a weak storyline and a no-suspense mystery drowns Enola Holmes into disappointment.
My Rating : 2.5/5""",5
summertrianglestars,"""Y'all Need to Chill""",23 September 2020,"""This is a fictional story about Enola Holmes--not Sherlock Holmes. The name ""Sherlock"" is more of a setting/narrative device than a relevant character. We should expand our perception of how an intelligent person behaves, speaks, and looks. Being unfeeling, being a sociopath, and being hooked on cocaine, should not be (and certainly isn't the case in the real world) identifiers for a genius person.
Normally, I don't like films that hit you over the head with the feminist message--because it normally isn't done well. This time it's part of the character, it's a developed concept, and it's a developed narrative. Relax. No reason to get heated. Just enjoy it. A solid Netflix release. Would personally love for a sequel.""",8

mighty-maddox,"""Cringe-inducing""",25 September 2020,"""I liked Sherlock's soft side. Otherwise this film is a total failure. Suffered through half of it and then skimmed through the other half. Spectacularly bad writing. Awkward dialogues. Cardboard characters and common misconceptions. Corsets as symbols of oppression? Female boarding schools existing solely to turn free-thinking, spirited girls into socially accepted matrons? Ugh. Usual nonsense about white privilege, raging feminism, insulting men left and right... This is simply unwatchable. I am a non-white woman, by the way, so films like this one are supposed to appeal to me? The heroine's constant breaking the fourth wall is another very annoying feature.A side note from a Holmes fan POV: Mycroft in this film is not Mycroft. It's someone else: a small, skinny guy with zero intellect and deductive powers. And NO WATSON. Waste of time.""",2

The film is a beautiful compliment and nod to multiple Sherlock series but with it's own unique take from a feminine perspective that presents as both traditional and sardonic at the same time. Only wish was that Sherlock was a bit more involved.""",9

It hits it's intended target quite well and keep the stories living and breathing and of interest for the next generation instead of letting the Sherlock Holmes wither and die.

It's rated M for the action sequences, which were well done, but definitely had that PG feel to it. The production design, acting, soundtrack, and pacing of the story were all very good... I would have scripted the final 15 minutes differently, but it still worked in the scheme of the plot and the motivations of the main characters.

alexpitt-345-971699,"""Enola Holmes - Movie Review""",26 September 2020,"""I was excited for Enola Holmes as soon as it was first announced, and even more so when they started adding A-list talent to the picture.Millie Bobby Brown is known for her breakout role in Stranger Things, but I hadn't been impressed with her work in anything else I'd seen. Granted, she hasn't been in much that I've watched, but her performance in Godzilla: King of the Monsters was very sub-par. That being said, that film suffered from a terrible screenplay and direction which didn't help.The performance that Brown gives in Enola Holmes is terrific, and probably the best she has ever been. That includes Stranger Things, by the way. Henry Cavill and Sam Claflin are near perfection at embodying the roles of Sherlock and Mycroft. It's definitely Brown's film, but these two talented actors added a lot to the scenes they were in.The narrative is good, but not great. The story isn't as compelling as it probably should have been, and the pacing was all over the place. Fifteen minutes could have easily been trimmed off the runtime, maybe even twenty. I didn't care much for the mother's storyline, and the ending was very anti-climactic.Those are my main negatives, but the film is entirely watchable based purely on the performances and the light hearted tone. The narration and forth-wall breaks also worked for me.The cinematography was beautiful, and it's easily one of the best looking films available on Netflix. I mentioned that the ending was anti-climactic, but it did have some nice messages sprinkled throughout.Overall, despite its issues, I had a really good time with Enola Holmes and I would recommend checking it out. Even if you just watch it for the acting, the characters, and the cinematography, you will probably end up having a good time with the film.SCORE: 76%""",8
revchristodd,"""Perfectly Enjoyable YA Adventure""",24 September 2020,"""Some of the reviewers here seem to be under the impression that this is a Sherlock Holmes story. It is not. It is about a hitherto unknown teenage sister of his, and the tone is a bit more like ""Young Sherlock Holmes"" than ""The Hound of the Baskervilles."" It is a YA adventure about a girl searching for her identity while avoiding the normal fate of a young woman in Victorian England. While evading her brothers Mycroft and Sherlock, Enola Holmes stumbles across a missing viscount and is torn between solving his mystery and that of her vanished mother. Millie Bobbie Brown carries the film well and Henry Clavell appears just often enough to remind us of Sherlock's connection with Enola. There is little true deduction but some word puzzles and a brisk enough pace to keep the kids interested. It's a fun evening's entertainment for the whole family.""",8

elohimgibor,"""#meetooo""",23 September 2020,"""At first, I was quite excited when I noticed a new Holmes movie on Netflix. At first glance it seemed like great flick: A-list cast, centered around a great mystery and lovely decor. I didn't mind at all that the movie was centered around Sherlock's less well known sister Enola, and that the movie had some sort of feministic background.However, as the movie progressed, the latter became obvious to a point where it became very annoying and the movie itself, for it's time period, unrealistic (for example, a secret all-women jiu jitsu class in the early 1900s? Yeah, sure). All other classes, races and genders in the movie seem to have no troubles or problems at all, only the wonen. which at the time was certainly not the case.Also, as is unfortunately the case with many #metoo pleasing movies nowadays, the male characters were all either evil, bumbling idiots, or completely helpless with the sole exception of Sherlock Holmes, who doesn't get much screen time.Don't get me wrong, I love many movies with female lead characters (underworld, pan's labyrinth, resident evil, etc). I just really dislike this current wave of overcompensated feminist-focused movies that keep using the same old formula, and forget that there was actually supposed to be a decent plotline in the movie.

I just felt like the director thinks I'm too dumb to understand most basic concepts. The second and perhaps a key issue with the movie is it's aggresive use of 'so called' feminism. Being aggressive towards men, constantly telling them that they are useless is not an act of strength, but of weakness. Is this the message we want to convey to our youth? That in order to be a strong woman you must believe that men are somewhat of a lesser being? Think no need to say that such a portrial of the main characters has little to do with any historical relevance. But this part I can forgive, as it is supposed to be just a simple 'feel good' movie.

Enola misbehaves all the time, even when the rules have nothing to do with gender (like don´t throw food at others, don´t slurp, don´t steal someone´s car...).
All of this is made to seem normal, even heroic actions.
Enola´s runaway mother doesn´t have the decency of explaining herself in the end of the film. She disappeared on her daughter´s birthday, leaving some clues that led nowhere.

Most Sherlock Holmes movies I know, not only the old classics (Basil Rathbone!) and the new ones with Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law alike, including Young Sherlock Holmes and the Pyramid of Fear (watch if you don't know that one!) are superior to this ""Tomb Raidered"" version (not those good ones with Angelina but the ""modern"" interpretation with Alicia Vikander). My rating is a 5 but one point I added only for the charming performance of Millie Bobby Brown.Diabolic note: like Adam was first and Eve second (according to the Holy Bible), the creation of the character of Enola is also second to the creation of the wonderful Sherlock Holmes by the titan Arthur Conan Doyle.

And this film is pure fantasy, not even attempting to look into the moral codes and etiquette of Victorian society, but instead throwing in random disparate elements including all-female ju jitsu clubs and the sight of a random artistocrat cavorting around the countryside with a female minor. The plot hinges on a ridiculous, underwritten and uninteresting mystery, while the cast is littered with familiar faces ill at ease in their roles: Helena Bonham Carter, whose entire role is rather pointless; Henry Cavill, who couldn't be more miscast if he tried. The only decent performances come from Burn Gorman (once more typecast as an assassin) and the excellent Millie Bobby Brown, whose charisma and exuberance shine off the screen.""",3

vivekbha,"""A tint of feminism in Victorian-era London""",24 September 2020,"""GENERAL OVERVIEW:In the footsteps of her elder brother Sherlock, Enola Holmes finds herself as a slueth/decipherer in finding her runaway mother - who wants to make the world a safe place for her daughter to live in - and not be dictated by the Victorian style of bounded feminity.DIRECTION & CINEMATOGRAPHY:Being the most vibrant color-coded film of the year, Mr. Nuttigen makes an impressive camera use and lighting techniques to highlight the dosage of free and independent young girl, trying to gain freedom from the clutches of a ""proper British lady"". Mr. Bradbeer knows his vision to bring his heroine to Baker Street and turn her a franchise star. We'll have to wait for what he has to offer us in the future with a Heroine we are growing fond of.ACTING:Millie takes home a charm of her own, by bringing Enola from the books to the screen for her visceral teen beauty for people to fall in love with. Her wit and charm is constantly triggered by her free will and constraint borders, which serve as fresh air in the Holmes universe. Mr. Cavill is a poignant slueth, Sherlock, except I would still give Benedict proving a better Sherlock ( A Debate? )
Helena Bonham Carter is always graceful, one of the finest, most refined actors in the industry.FINAL CALL:This fresh take on the female-centric Holmes is nothing less than fun, entertaining and visceral future franchise that would bloom by our Enola presenting gracefully a star of her own production, who has a bright future to interact. The story telling is exponentially low than the Guy Ritchie franchise (who is a wonderful filmmmaker, himself) and hence we get his inspiration in the quick cuts and sliding zoom-pan play which he stylized. This is a good dose for a weekend, or probably a late night which guarantee to stay awake and enjoy to the fullest.""",6

The main character is superb with brilliant acting and lovely to look at. For her tender age she is especially amazing! I really enjoyed the movie and was surprised at the low score. Maybe as more people of intelligence watch it the score will rise. Every age has people before their time inhabit it. How asinine to think that girls are only capable of sewing and breeding. There would have been many who knew they were more and fought for that. The budding romance is sweet as well. It is a family movie which is another bonus. Leading actors filled the roles so nothing shabby about that either. It is smooth and funny and thought provoking and an all round good film for the entire family or to watch by yourself.

CANpatbuck3664,"""Diverting Enough for Adults but a Slam Dunk as a Family Friendly Take on the Holmes Family""",4 October 2020,"""I had the same reaction everyone else did when I heard about Enola Holmes, did we really need ANOTHER take on the Sherlock Holmes and/or his family? But centring in on Enola was a different enough choice to justify the production. Enola approaches Mary Sue territory but the writer's handling of her struggle for independence and her determination to forge her own path in a man's world came across as genuine and very grounded. She's easy to like and while her skill set is diverse, her vulnerability with the disappearance of her mother also rings true. She's annoyingly talented (to be fair, Sherlock has always been that way in every incarnation of the character) but the creative team did a good job rounding out her character into a solid young heroine for kids. She is also buoyed by Brown's performance but more on that later.While the focus may be on Enola, we do get some familiar stylistic touches that both help the movie along but they also add enough to keep you interested. Enola consistently breaks the 4th wall and talks to the audience (its a fun dynamic, its a little hit or miss but again credit Brown for doing her best to sell it), Enola's ability to solve puzzles and fight oncoming foes are done with cutaways to previous experiences (just like the Guy Ritchie movies) and you also have some sharp dialogue. It all fits the genre well enough and gets the job done. I don't think this production had a huge budget but at least the costuming and the sets are solid, I didn't notice any shoddy CGI or clunky editing to interrupt the flow either.This is Millie Bobby Brown's showcase, she dominates the screentime and I'm happy to say she's largely up to the task. This was a good project for her to take, Enola is so different from 11 on Stranger Things. She's expressive in this (she's great in Stranger Things but Eleven is a pretty dour and dramatic character, Enola gives her room to stretch) and she has to run the whole gauntlet. Is there the occasional awkward beat? Yes, there are times where she looks a little uncomfortable. But it was nice see her do something different and she succeeds (I was a little worried that her success might have been a one off after the lacklustre Godzilla: King of the Monsters). Henry Cavill is good as Sherlock but surprisingly, its not a rich part in this movie. He's clearly a supporting character and while he has a few nice moments with Enola, he's not as domineering as other actors have played this part. He's largely relegated to the background with Sam Claflin. I felt sorry for Sam, he's given little to do but mug and chew scenery as Mycroft. It seemed like the direction he was given was ""MORE SNOOTY!"" ""PRETEND EVERYONE ELSE AROUND YOU ARE GARBAGE PEOPLE!"" Claflin has more range then he's given credit for but this was a one note performance. Helena Bonham Carter does what she can, she works well with Brown and helps you buy their deep bond and understand Enola's loss when Eudoria leaves/is taken. Louis Partridge is fine as Tewkesbury, his character's friendship with Enola is at least passable and it wasn't too corny for a family film.My only gripe with Enola Holmes is that if you're an adult viewing this by yourself, minus a couple of good performances and some witty moments courtesy of the dialogue, there isn't a lot here. The mystery is pretty simple, any rough edges the story had have long been sanded away and the movie wraps up in a neat little bow. While I think Enola is a good enough effort, I can understand why Doyle purists or fans of the other Sherlock property would view it as a lesser version.By the time Enola gets past the climactic moments, I was happy enough with the final product but I don't think this was aimed at my demographic. If I were a kid, I would have loved this. Between the snappy dialogue, Brown's energetic performance, the 4th wall breaking and a simple enough mystery that avoids the edgy or hardcore aspects of the labour reform and suffrage movements, I would have been swept up in it. If you're really into the Conan Doyle's work or have a more than passing knowledge of this universe, there may be some continuity issues or implausible beats. But Enola was a decent couple of hours spent on Netflix and if you're expectations are properly adjusted, I'd recommend it as an undemanding but fun streaming experience for families.""",7

Harry Bradbeer managed to handle the breaking of the 4th wall very well, and the immense charisma of Millie Bobby Brown helped, at times was unnecessary, but at other times, it really helped the viewer not to get lost with so many things happening at the same time. Despite leaving a taste of wanting more from Sherlock, which is extremely well-portrayed by Henry Cavill, it is clear that Enola does not depend on him to unravel something and that she is completely capable of doing the job alone, which is also included in the incredible intelligence of the character throughout the entire trajectory during the course of the narrative. The protagonist and Louis Partdrige built a simply incredible chemistry with Enola and Lord, making the viewer hope too much for their final kiss, but still, the film does not deviate from its proposal and doesn't let the romance stays in the first place.

vesil_vesalier,"""Creative. Refreshing. Funny. Charming. Beautiful. Well done!""",24 September 2020,"""The first time I saw Millie Bobby Brown was, like so many others, in STRANGER THINGS. I'd heard about the show from so many people, and didn't get the hype until I rolled the dice and gave it a shot. Being a huge fan of Stephen King's work helped to make me appreciate something truly unique and even special in the show.It's refreshing, being someone growing older in years, to see such talent in the new generations to come.ENOLA HOLMES stars Millie as Enola, Henry Cavill as Sherlock, Sam Claflin as Mycroft, and the always legendary and wonderful Helena Bonham Carter as their mother, Eudoria. It was directed by Mr. Harry Bradbeer who, up until this point, seems to have only directed television episodes and shorts.First thing's first then... hats off to you, sir! For a wide selection of choices that I found to be absolutely wonderful in delivery, charm, humor and writing. However you managed to pull all of this together is quite surprising and refreshingly original.Three things stand out for me in this film. The first is the choice to constantly break the third wall, as they say. Looking back at the film it was quite a bold and wonderful way to make light of something that could have been a much more serious film - which would have detracted from its overall delivery. I laughed out loud SO many times during the run of the film and have thoroughly enjoyed the ride.The second was the cinematography. I have a bad habit of sounding out ""Beautiful shot"" whenever I see one in a film, and this one had so many I was floored. The scope of the camera amidst lush green forests and broad spectrum cityscapes truly added to the wonder of the film. I have the urge to attempt to go and capture as many as I can and have them scroll through the background of the desktop of my computer.The last was Millie herself. While watching STRANGER THINGS I have been impressed by EVERYONE'S acting (well except for Wynona Rider maybe, but I've always been on the fence with her ability anyway). I liked Millie's delivery, but felt the same way I did when I was watching Emma Watson in Harry Potter... I saw potential, but a lack of experience. It is wholeheartedly refreshing to see Millie really strut her stuff here. She is amazing, and I look forward to everything she will do with her career as the years roll by.Now I'm not going to claim the film is perfect. It does have some pacing issues, where the flow slows to a crawl in some spots and takes a bit too long to pick back up again. Also the entire stretch of the story involving Enola attempting to conform with the school she's assigned to felt unnecessary and even somewhat poorly delivered. Sam Claflin's Mycroft doesn't have the charm I'm used to seeing in other portrayals of Sherlock's brother, to the point where he was infuriatingly unfeeling toward his sister and her situation, making him more of a nuisance than I felt he should have been.But these issues are very small, and the parts the film hits on more than make up for the misses. I almost forgot to mention Tewkesbury, played by Louis Partridge, who at first seemed to be a bit of an empty character, only to develop nicely as the film rolled on.Helena Bonham Carter needs to be mentioned, so much as she doesn't need to be. A legend in her own right, she gives the film exactly what it needs in the few scenes she is in, as the caring but mysterious mother of the Holmes clan. I've never seen her deliver a bad performance, and she does her usual here.All in all, I loved ENOLA HOLMES. It's charming in its delivery, beautiful in its scenery, hilarious in its humor and touching just where it needs to be in all the right places. I had a lot of fun watching this film, and I look forward to watching it again when the opportunity presents itself.""",9

Picky people hated the acting in the early Harry Potter films, and some people hated all of them, yet they endured. This YA series is no where near HP, but it's nice to see young female protagonist.
Maybe she can have a crossover with the Alienist.""",8
chrisrowexxx,"""Feel good movie, charming and great setting.""",27 September 2020,"""I can only score it for what it is , it's not much of a plot, quite dialogue heavy, often relying on amazing settings to distract you from what can feel a long film with many periods of not much happening. It was nicely put together , interesting that MBB got a producer credit, wonder how much she did or if it was an incentive to sign on. I have to admit I felt this was written with her in mind. The rest of the cast were fine, some quirky characters but mostly just plain stereotypes with a slightly more cartoonish quality.The mom steals a living, the amount of beginning and end films I've seen her do where she's far more absent than present is so odd. Didn't think this was one of her better roles, without the cooky stuff I don't find her to be a very good performer. Think I got used to Tim burton versions. The brothers were fine, the villains and accomplices were decent, nothing special but nothing bad. Scenery was awesome.Only two gripes is yet another woman good men bad vibe. Hopefully when people learn equality means to treat the same not one good one bad in either variation, the world will be far better.I'm going to be honest as she was in it, I loved stranger things, thought she was phenomenal in that, such a talent, loved her in this her comic timing was great, however I feel this was made with her in mind and if it'd have been anyone else I feel not only less interest but I reckon I'd have scored it 4. I enjoyed seeing someone I like in a new setting which helps, there's a lot of love for her and rightly so but being honest if you took her out for anyone this would've been, boring, too long, weak storyline and just another bang average film.""",7

essiemew,"""Certainly had fun!""",30 September 2020,"""I'm writing this review solely out of spite. I am a massive fan of all the people calling ""PC culture!"" and ""historical inaccuracy!"", for with a quick google of ""womens self defense history"", I came across quite a few articles that show that, hilariously (which I actually didn't expect!), Jiujitsu classes were indeed taught around the turn of the 20th century! Here's one, for all those with an open mind, and an ACTUAL interest in history.
Now that that's out of the way... Enola Holmes was a pretty good movie. I did not feel the diversity was too forced, but characterization often got on my nerves as much as it did some other critics and fans of Sherlock Holmes. However, I think after Arsène Lupin, rewritings of Sherlock are honestly not that big of a deal.
This is a movie for teenage girls, made in a time with a harsh political climate. This movie is perfect for that. It has typical teenage girl fiction tropes, of being a tough and strong girl, about being special, and about finding a love by chance (which annoyed me, but I'm not the target audience, so whatever). So I think they did that fantastically. For anybody else, it's just a fun movie for if you want to spend an afternoon with your family watching a light-hearted yet meaningful movie. Not a cinematic masterpiece, but not at all warranting the criticism it receives.""",7

Disguised as a comedy/mystery, it reveals to us the english society and it's flaws. Equal rights has always been a tough fight and we get to see a glimpse of how the women at that time were battling it and the sacrifices they had to make. My favourite thing about the movie is the subtle reversal of traditional gender roles throughout. Plus the acting is brilliant. Some incredible performances by Brown, Cavill and Carter. Definitely worth a watch.""",8

It's an adorably fun film that has classic characters in it but isn't centered around them. It's not intended to be a Sherlock Holmes tale but it gives off Sherlock vibes in Enolas character.Everyone saying it's a ""feminist"" movie, is just upset because the lead is a female that isn't a traditional young lady for the time period. But neither was Sherlock. That's why it's so fun. She's very similar to her brother and has characteristics similar to his at that age. That's the fun of it. It's just a fun movie.And what's wrong with showing a strong young woman that's just been thrown into a different world, a word of adventure. Especially in that time period. Nobody would have complained if the character would have been male or a younger Sherlock going through the same scenario. It's just showing a strong, smart, and intelligent young adult, regardless of gender, on an adventure.Watch the movie. It's family friendly and it's a fantastic adventure.

This is not a Sherlock Holmes film, with deductions and logical puzzles being solved, but indeed an entertainingly lighthearted film as Enola sets forth into the world to discover her own path in life after her Mother leaves her all alone. With the lessons that her mother bestowed upon her from a young age, Enola sets out to find her Mother but not before her Brothers, Sherlock and Mycroft, arrive to insist on a different path. Mycroft, as her ward, has different plans to what Elona has for herself, believing that Elona needs to first become a young Lady at a finishing school, Elona then begins her journey to find her mother.

Now on the plot the mystery it served for Enola to solve was pretty simple. I am thankful that Sherlock solved it before her figuring out to show that he is actually the same deductive man. Enola is learning as she is so young. I liked how she had a hint of emotional side and not so emotional and driven my task like her brother, but definitely not quite as stern as her brother.

The girl is 16 and just beginning to see the world and put her deductive skills to use. And Sherlock was not born with a magnifying glass in his hand either! But apparently since no one has done an ""origin"" story of Sherlock people can't comprehend that he had to start somewhere too, and so is Enola now.
And no, the movie is not too ""woke"". British women gained the right to vote in 1918, and this takes place in 1900 so it's not too far off for them to have started the suffrage movement.
The movie was beautiful, fun and had a good message. Not really a fan of breaking the 4th wall but Millie Bobby Brown is adorable so I'll give it a pass. The Tewksbury case wasn't very complicated but, again, following the clues to her mother makes up for it.

Because is not a Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's character, therefore, don't expect more of the same.And last but not least, for what we are here:The movie explores the awakening of a young woman (no matter what her surname is) who happends to be raised in an uncommon way for her time, but has the same concerns as any other teenage girl. They show all the aspects of that 'new life' regarding, for example, how she applies her knowledge in this unknown world and by herself. Different kinds of love: self love, siblings and family, a potencial lover. And how she is starting (and learning about) her possible career as a detective.Also, being a huge fan of Sherlock I can think that this particular and 'changed' character can be two things:
Simply a different approach because is a different story.
Or maybe we can imagine is an unknown aspect of his life. Where we can see him in the role of an older brother that is worried and moved by his little sister that wasn't in his life as much as needed to be. Which is a really good and refreshing point of view...""",8

Just watch this like how Riverdale took the names of the characters but not the character themselves. Overall this is more like a kiddy quirky version with just a touch of Sherlock. The direction reminds me of Eloise Disney movies. It has the same vibe.A lot of the low reviews lament on the historical accuracy which I think you should take with a grain of salt. History is not the main thing here. It's not a documentary at all. This is simply the adventure of a girl finding herself which just happened to be in the 19th century. I think they put enough of the real society for it to work.I didn't really see any problem with the feminism in here as well.. it's not even in your face like other movies. It's just a woman's POV...Enola's POV so of course the rest of the cast will take a back seat to which if you have a problem with... I suggest you don't watch this or you'll just be disappointed.There's a lot of little plots happening in the background (could be a hodge-podge and convoluted for some) but for me it works because it's not about them but Enola.

I found myself wanting to see more of Enola tracking down her mother then Enola and Teweksbury. Then there's an even worse storyline about this boarding school. The boarding school scenes didn't nothing for the plot and bored me to tears. They could have just had Enola escape the hotel with Teweksbury.

Enola doesn't use even 1% of brain, and the only deduction she makes is wrong. How's this a detective story if there's no investigation or deductions made?

bob-the-movie-man,"""The unsinkable Millie Bobby Brown""",4 October 2020,"""Sherlock Holmes never had a sister. But if he did, what adventures would Enola Holmes get up to? That's the premise behind this Netflix feature. starring rising star Millie Bobby Brown.Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown) thinks she's been named as such because it spells ""alone"" backwards. (But then, she admits, that it doesn't seem to follow for either kcolrehs or tforcym!)Enola has been brought up by her dearest mother Eudoria (Helena Bonham Carter) to be a strong and confident woman, free of the normal 19th century rituals of ladylike husband-seeking niceties: for her, it's all mental gymnastics and martial arts. But when on her 16th birthday her mother vanishes, Enola sets out on a quest to find her. But Eudoria is a Holmes, and knows the value of clues and how to cover her tracks.Of greater concern to Enola is her brother and ward Mycroft (Sam Claflin), who is intent on packing her off to the Victorian finishing school of Miss Harrison (""Killing Eve's"" Fiona Shaw). But while trying to escape from her brothers - not a trivial matter when one is the famous detective Sherlock (Henry Cavill) - Enola encounters a Marquess on the run (Louis Partridge) and adventure, intrigue and murder are on the cards.Filming in this ""Fleabag"" style - where the lead is constantly breaking the fourth wall - requires a confidence in delivery that many young actors would struggle with. But not Millie Bobby Brown. Her asides and camera glances - while not quite as skillful as the astonishingly accomplished Phoebe Waller-Bridge - are nonetheless impressive and constantly entertaining. An underwater wink at the camera was particularly enjoyable.So... actress - tick!But perhaps more impressive to me was that the 16 year old - most famous for her role in ""Stranger Things"", which I still haven't watched - was also a PRODUCER of this movie. Which makes me think she is a serious person to watch in the movie business (if there ever is a movie business left after 2020). I read that she is the youngest person ever to appear on the annual list of the ""world's 100 most influential people"" by Time magazine: so others agree!The supporting case are a broad array of British acting talent, with Henry Cavill being particularly appealing as Sherlock, Burn Gorman at his slimy evil best as a murderous henchman, and Sam Claflin being as anonymous as I always find him. (That's a compliment by the way: whereas I see some actors and think ""oh, there's 'Tom Hanks' again"", I never recognize Claflin until the credits role... he is a chameleon of the acting world).But acting the socks off everyone else for me is Frances de la Tour as the Marquess's grandmother. A deliciously twinkling and charming performance from an old dame of the screen.The similarities with ""Fleabag"" are not coincidental, since the director is Harry Bradbeer; director of all of the episodes except the original pilot. But it's unfortunate in some ways that the style has been interpolated into the Holmes story. Since, of course, this approach was previously done by Guy Ritchie in the two very entertaining movies featuring Robert Downey Jnr and Jude Law. And for me, that's a shame. Since although the styles are markedly different - here we have a lot of Paddington-style cardboard animations - the ""feel"" of the films is the same. As such, it doesn't feel as novel as it should do. Why couldn't she have been someone else's sister? Houdini perhaps? Or Oscar Wilde?As two hours of entertaining escapism, Enola Holmes worked well for me. Brown is eminently watchable, and given the Netflix response to the movie, a sequel would be - I expect - on the cards.(For the full graphical review, please visit One Mann's Movies on t'interweb or Facebook.

MrDHWong,"""A fun, free spirited adventure lifted by an engaging performance from its lead actress""",1 October 2020,"""Enola Holmes is a coming-of-age mystery film based on the book ""The Enola Holmes Mysteries: The Case of the Missing Marquess"" by Nancy Springer, which itself is loosely based on the stories of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Starring Millie Bobby Brown in the title role, it is a fun, free spirited adventure lifted by an engaging performance from its lead actress.In 19th century England, Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown), the younger sister of the famous detectives Sherlock Holmes (Henry Cavill) and Mycroft Holmes (Sam Claflin), has been taught by her mother Eudoria (Helena Bonham Carter) to be just as clever, observant, and proficient in hand-to-hand combat as her older brothers. On the morning of her sixteenth birthday, Enola awakens to discover her mother has disappeared, leaving her with a deciphering device and scattered clues hidden away in some flowers. Believing these clues lead to her mother's whereabouts, Enola sets off on a journey and follows the trail to London. Meanwhile, Enola's brothers desperately try to track her down, albeit, with their own conflicting methods of deduction and detective work.The Sherlock Holmes series of stories I believe needs no introduction. Its impact on pop culture and storytelling still resonates strongly even after more than 130 years since the very first book was penned by its author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. As is often the case with something this popular, there are bound to be spin-offs featuring either some of its core characters or brand new ones existing within the same universe. What ""Enola Holmes"" does successfully is invent an entirely new relative of the Holmes family, in that of a strong willed little sister. This works well as it can introduce a new generation of viewers to this classic series with a young protagonist they can identify with while also bringing a fresh burst of originality that casual audiences can appreciate as well. Like her older brothers, Enola finds great joy in solving mysteries and using her intellect to discover important clues along the way. Since the story is set in an era where women were expected to act more ladylike, it certainly makes scenes with Enola fighting through the social norms of that time all the more fun to watch. I'm not sure if this happens in the book, but she often breaks the fourth wall, directly addressing the audience over how she has been raised to handle any predicament she lands herself in or even what certain clues might mean if they seem too complicated for the casual viewer. This was a fun quirk to add to a film like this and I'm sure that young people will find it all the more entertaining as a result.Director Harry Bradbeer has clearly taken a great deal of influence from that of the works of Guy Ritchie. Ritchie's brisk, fast-paced, choppily edited approach to filmmaking has been heavily applied here, which seems appropriate considering he directed the 2009 and 2011 contemporary film adaptations of Sherlock Holmes starring Robert Downey Jr and Jude Law. This definitely prevented the film from becoming boring or dragging at any time, as it manages to hold the audience's attention throughout the story. However, I do feel that certain aspects of the film's plot may be confusing to some younger audiences, mainly the one involving the passing of an important government bill in the House of Lords. Even though the film doesn't dwell on this aspect for too long, I can't help but feel that any youths who may be watching will be scratching their heads over what the implications of such a bill passing will mean to our protagonist. Older audiences should have no trouble of course, but considering this film is clearly aimed at teens to young adults, I just wish this was handled somewhat better.In what can be best described as her most fun performance to date, Millie Bobby Brown simply owns the role of Enola Holmes. Brown, who also serves as an executive producer for the film, injects so much peppy energy into her portrayal of this character that one cannot help but feel charmed by her and her eagerness for adventure. But this wasn't simply a one actor movie, as both Henry Cavill and Sam Claflin were also enjoyable to watch as Sherlock and Mycroft, respectively. As has usually been seen in most forms of Sherlock Holmes media, the two brothers don't always see eye-to-eye and often clash over their opposing views of the world around them. Here, Cavill plays Sherlock with a more laid back personality, supporting whatever path his younger sister wishes to follow, while Claflin plays Mycroft as a more strict and conservative older guardian who wants his youngest sibling to succeed in social settings. This dynamic added some nice additional drama to the film and showed how much they care about their little sister, even if it is for different reasons. Additionally, it was also interesting to see both Brown and Cavill using their natural English accents, as I am so used to seeing them play American characters.With there already being so many prior adaptations of the Sherlock Holmes stories, this film definitely feels like an enjoyable contemporary inclusion to this ever-expanding library of reimaginings of this long-running series. Since this film only covers the first of six books in ""The Enola Holmes Mysteries"", it seems inevitable that at least one more sequel is on the horizon. As long as Millie Bobby Brown, Henry Cavill, and Sam Claflin are set to return, then count me in.I rate it 7.5/10""",8

Funny and brilliant character she brought to life, really engaging story, supporting cast was awesome. You can tell from the trailer it was going to a fun and different take on the Sherlock legacy, focusing on his younger sister. Millie talking directly to the viewers was also fun to watch, with her speaking into the camera was similar to The Office. There were many serious and dramatic moments, both emotional and visual. The villains were well portrayed, those actors made you fear and hate them. If they make a series I'll watch every episode! Nicely done.""",9

Wollyams,"""Mansplaining: The Movie.""",30 September 2020,"""One thing that increasingly irks me about Jack Thorne's scripts - despite this one's admitted strength - is the blatantly noticeable hypocrisy of them; so often within his screenplays, he clearly attempts to showcase enlightenment, championing the voices of the oppressed by depicting the struggles that they either currently do or have had to endure throughout history. Now this wouldn't be an issue if his actions were consistent with the words he puts out to the public but his inability to live by the same mantra is increasingly conspicuous with each & every new project which announces his involvement.It's all very fair & well saying to minorities ""your voices deserve to be heard & you should make them so"" but when you're the same straight white cis man who essentially talks over them by simultaneously writing pretty much every single British TV show & feature film within the UK creative industry, it has to be said how depriving minorities of the same opportunities to tell their stories - by harbouring them all for yourself & taking up multiple slots each year in a content provider's release schedule - is rather indefensible, when you think about it?This is the same man who ensured no undiscovered or emerging talent could partake in the scripting process for his most recent show (His Dark Materials) by insisting on writing each & every single episode solely by himself. He had 8 installments & not a single one of them was guest written. If he actually cared half as much about representation as he obviously would like us to think he does, he'd use his platform to amplify their voices instead of giving his fictional characters meaningless motivational speeches. Prioritise providing real individuals with the opportunities to prove their capabilities... That would matter more - but he doesn't. For instance, you want to champion the voices of women, as a man, why not just let a woman write the adaptation of Enola Holmes instead? That's recognising your privilege & allowing someone else the chance for a change. Put your money where your mouth is - otherwise your liberalism is simply hollow & performative.""",8

A bit teenagerish but still well worth watching, a fun adventure. Enola's mother (Helena Bonham Carter) disappears and this brings Mycroft and Sherlock back into her life. The stuffy Mycroft wants to send her to a Finishing School run by Miss Harrison (Fiona Shaw) but Enola runs away. Meeting up with a young aristocrat who is also fleeing from pushy relatives she gets involved in great capers. Political conspiracies, Suffragette agitation and more. We mostly see Carter in flashbacks but she has trained Enola in martial arts. Sherlock (Henry Cavill) is restrained in this adventure, Enola taking the lead but hopefully he'll crop up again in future adventures.

alindsay-al,"""An Average Film That Could Have A Bright Future""",23 September 2020,"""So a few months ago we heard that this film was coming to Netflix and today was that day and here is my review for Enola Holmes. The premise of the film sees Sherlock Holmes teen sister have to go on her own investigation when her mum goes missing.Main Character
Millie Bobby Brown of Stranger Things fame plays Enola Holmes and honestly I thought she was the best part of this film. She is really charming, charismatic and fun to watch, she actually has a nice arc throughout the film and she is just a good lead character. You see that she has been poorly treated and it makes you care about her and want to see her one up her brothers as they annoy her throughout the film and treat her poorly. If we get more of these films I think she has a chance to really build an interesting character here.Supporting Characters
Sam Claflin plays her older brother called Mycroft and I thought he did a decent job, yes his character is pretty generic and you know he is going to be an antagonist but he does a good job in the role and seems to be enjoying himself here in the role. Now Henry Cavill is a great actor and he plays Sherlock Holmes here and I just thought it wasn't the right fit, it's not that he is bad, it is just that he doesn't fit the character and it feels like he is miscast and his character is pretty poorly written, especially, with how he ends up. Helena Bonham Carter plays her mother and she doesn't do much in this film, it just seems that she is a terrible mother and it makes you wonder if Enola would be better without her. Also there is this love interest here and it didn't work, I just wish this film didn't have a love interest as tgis felt like a forced part of the film.Story
The story when it comes to Enola is well done. her character is interesting and the development is there. You see how smart and capable she is and it allows you to take her seriously as a protagonist. But then the rest of the plot happens, her relationship with her brothers isn't explored enough, the search for her mother is forgotten about and then there is this dull political story involving the love interest and none of it is interesting. The film tries to have twists and turns but they make no sense and you are literally given no reason to care about any of it, apart from Enola herself.Script
The script is fine, with Enola herself having some good dialogue that just makes her very likeable, also I liked how she worked out the clues and I thought that was pretty well written. But then the drama isn't there and it honestly feels like they were writing 4 films in one, the script is too unfocused and makes it difficult to focus and get invested into anything.Style
The style of the film is entertaining, Enola does her best Deadpool impression by breaking the fourth wall alot here and I actually thought it worked, you don't see it much and I liked its usage here, even though it is never quite explained why she does it. But the pacing of the film is poor and as I mentioned the film is pretty unfocused which leads the ending to feel rushed and wonder what has happened.Overall
Overall, this is a pretty average film, but surprisingly I actually want to see a sequel. I like the character of Enola Holmes and I think with a more focused film the sequel could be much better. But this film isn't really worth your time unless you are bored and have a few hours spare.""",5
jessicambarringer,"""Enjoyable""",23 September 2020,"""If you're looking for Sherlock vibes you're not going to find it here. But nevertheless it was clever and I wasn't expecting the most clever of plot twists. I've been waiting for this to come out and I wasn't disappointed. I don't believe this was a hard core feminism movement movie it has hardcore elements, yes (which the reviews have portrayed). But everything was enjoyable. Great for kids. The reviews of 1 star are absolutely asinine IMHO, I've seen far worse movies and still enjoyed them. Great actors, delivered well, fun easy plot to follow. I write a review so hopefully it balances out the haters. *le sigh*""",9
maysaif,"""Feel good, family friendly movie""",23 September 2020,"""First of all, people need to realize that this is NOT a Sherlock Holmes story, so stop comparing it to Sherlock & rating it that way.I'm a stickler when it comes to Sherlock too and I was worried that I wasn't going to like the character be played a bit differently from what I've seen in the trailer. But to my delight, even though Henry did not play the classic version of Sherlock, he still gave a wonderful performance with a softer version of the character that made Sherlock even more appealing which fit really well within this story.Second of all, this film is an absolute delight. I'm not usually a fan of breaking the 4th wall, but it worked well in this movie.Millie's performance was brilliant, the character fits her perfectly. She's a natural & is always a joy to watch.Now I understand that not everyone is a fan of feminism, I'm not particularly a feminist myself, but it still wasn't an overwhelming theme in this movie for me. It was done just right. So stop complaining about that. The movie is called ENOLA Holmes, what did you expect?If you don't particularly like the mystery storyline in this movie, then surely the music (which took me back to wonderful 1990s family movies), the acting, the costumes, the whole atmosphere and vibe of Victorian era England will make this movie worth watching.""",9

The production values and music were excellent, as the plot.Nineteenth century England finds, both Sherlock and Mycroft's teenaged sister, Enola (""Alone"" spelled backwards) on a quest to find their mother who has unexpectedly and mysteriously left their family home and Enola, being the child remaining there.Along the way, the plot moves at an even paced clip, with Enola recounting and using many of the skills her mother has taught her and exhibiting the brain power that her brothers possess to attempt to find her mother and assist a young traveler, a Viscount running from his wealth, family and responsibilities of peerage.Major threats to life and limb confront Enola, as she discovers more about herself, the times and her family. There is action throughout and I found only one large plot gap; but, it too, folds into an enjoyable bit of of screen viewing, for my part.Everything Is all packaged in an enjoyable film. So much so, I believe it should be a series.""",10

Instead of just showing us some strong female characters (and there are a lot of them in this movie, so that's great) it insists on constantly telling us that ""the world is changing"" and ""you can choose your own path in life"". These not-so-subtle messages are sometimes even narrated directly to the viewer by the main character.The old saying ""don't tell it, show it"" doesn't seem to be something the film makers have ever heard of.""",2

That said, this story is a mess and basically serves as a launch platform for Millie's career and little else.Towards the end it devolves into a plot-less hodge podge about something or other, then slams the viewer with a bunch of feminist talking points and then hides behind them, daring the viewer to criticise the cinematographic merits of the movie lest they be called out for being anti-feminist Conservative MAGA types.Well, I'm not buying it.Creating strong female leads is fine and dandy if you have a story that supports it organically - and that isn't new at all. Just look at Alien and others before and after it. Look at The Expanse TV show and even Millies' own Stranger Things. They all feature strong female leads, but the plots accommodate them naturally. Lately many movies seem to feel like the strong female lead has been shoehorned into the plot and that feels forced accordingly. In this case however, while the plot was written with a female lead in mind - the story itself was forced and all over the place and then it took a cheap political shot to try and hide that fact at the end.There were a few laughs though, to give it some credit - but little else.Basically it is aimed at young teenage girls.""",4

The characters, the world.. even the lighting, the background noises, the music. It is a perfectly constructed little story. Not much of a mystery (as you can see most everything from afar), but enough intrigue and adventure to make it entertaining. But what rises above it all is the interactions between the likeable characters (not you, Mycroft).It's an interesting idea, to have Sherlock as a background character looming about.. I've always enjoyed the idea of such a prominent persona not being the center of attention.. and Henry does a great job with it.The 2 leads are quite likeable as well.

Gosh, I presumed that his only family were his best friend Watson and his fans around the world. But there's a surprise for me right there! All the more delightful when you learn that Millie Bobby Brown, AKA El, is playing his sister named Enola, which when read backwards, reads Alone.
Well, this movie isn't about Sherlock at all as the title suggests. It brings into play tricky issues of the then topics like feminism, women empowerment, their subjugation and so forth. Clearly, Enola escapes the subjugation quite magnificently and in style, one which even impresses her virtuoso genius brother, Sherlock, not so much her obnoxious brother Mycroft, a name which sounds more like the name of some landmine.
To be honest, you might find the character of Sherlock underplayed. You won't see the eccentricities or the spectacularly outlandish charm that Holmes (Sherlock) is known for, but as stated before, he movie aint about him. So set your expectations straight.

Rishav1987365,"""Holmes to the Rescue""",6 October 2020,"""It is set in the background of early 1880s in England.
It starts when Enola Holmes , Sherlock's teen sister-discovers her mother missing, she sets off to find her, becoming a super-sleuth in her own right as she outwits her famous brother and unravels a dangerous conspiracy around a mysterious young Lord.
In my opinion Mille Bobby Brown is excellent, Sam Claflin is extraordinary and Henry Cavil is being Henry Cavil. The Production is great, the story is heart warming but the mystery is not to much.See the spin off with Henry Cavil as Sherlock Holmes is a mind blown. These universes of Sherlock is going wider and wider with each actor setting a different image as Sherlock. Where Benedict Cumberbatch sets a sly and mindful sherlock, more wit and less physical strength. Well Ferrell sets a more comic yet witty Sherlock. Robert Downey Jr. is more like a mastermind sherlock with both physical strength and wits but lack the British touch in his accent.
Taking things back to Enola Holmes, portraited by Millie Bobby Brown, is a delight to watch as she is young, goregous and talented. Her womenly appeal is depected more in this movie which was lacking in her appearance in Stranger Things.
Taking about the plot, direction ,set build-up it was a very beautifully done.
Overall I would like to conclude this video by saying. Its not something new you'll see but it will be worth your while.

medwards1,"""A very good film, held together with a scintillating lead performance from a young actress""",1 October 2020,"""I have not read any other reviews on here, but seeing the overall rating I can imagine there will be a lot of whinging.I would imagine the moaning comes primarily for two reasons:Firstly, I imagine big fans of the books will be mad that it doesn't fit exactly their perception of those books, and especially I guess, that Sherlock displays feelings and such.For me, I have never been a big fan of the books, and only really know the characters because of their endless repeated representation in film and TV.If you want portrayals of Sherlock more accurate to the books I suggest watching the old Basil Rahbone films. But if this is your primary concern, then you have somewhat missed the entire point of the film. As the title should suggest to you, this is a film about his sister, Enola. I am sure this is another bone of contention with the diehards. I have no idea if Enola was a character in the books or not, personally never heard of her before, so I imagine perhaps not, but to be honest, it doesn't really matter. By this stage there have been so very many versions of Sherlock Holmes presented to us on screen, I am sure that every single aspect of the characterisation of him from the novels has been bent if not broken before.Secondly, I imagine there are a lot of people moaning at the very idea a film should have a positive and affirmative role for a young woman. I am sure there are middle aged men with skin the hue of finely glazed gammon frothing at the mouth at the perceived 'wokeness' of this film (and probably badly disguising this angst with negative comments about acting etc).My view is that everyone needs role models, and if you don't know that this was a time period with particularly feisty and proactive feminist icons striving to make their way in varied 'male dominated' positions in society, then shame on you. This is a film that presents such a character. Educated and emboldened by a mother who said 'to hell with what society expects of us' this is a young woman who is on a quest to find herself, more than her mother, and although at the beginning she does not know what she wants, she very much knows what she does not want.I personally found Mille Bobby Brown utterly brilliant in this film. Perfect comedy timing, really good acting and a sense of purpose behind her role, borne no doubt out of her executive producer role in its production. She held our attention throughout, and created an interesting and inspiring character. Also, I must say, despite the push against the convention of how Sherlock is usually played, I really loved Henry Cavill in his role, and his scenes with Mille were some of the very best in the film.The films action was well paced and entertaining, and I ended feeling happy and smiling, like an old favourite Disney film.All in all I felt, for someone like my niece, or my younger female cousins, this film would be one of the best things ever made. For me, a man in his forties, I would give it a very solid 8 out of 10, and I hope we get to see more of this exciting character in future film projects.""",8

samson-abbott,"""Charming and sweet""",30 September 2020,"""Good acting, decent writing, and despite being put out for a younger target audience, still entertaining for an adult just looking for something to watch on Netflix.Despite having all the reason to consider Enola to be a Mary Sue, she is still likeable and her story is still entertaining.The two main messages of the movie are how girls and women (and everyone else, but the story is set against the backdrop of a feminist reform) control their own destinies, and that being a good person who stands up for the right values is the way you will control that destiny. I believe that is feminism in media done right, and I'm glad movies like Enola Holmes, Wonderwoman, and others are made to show that the two messages of the film go hand in hand.This definitely isn't going to be nominated by the academy or win any crazy awards, and if you judge the movie strictly by the caliber of cast, this movie could definitely make a case for being underwhelming.All that being said, I felt pretty good watching the movie, it was a cute story, and I would definitely watch a sequel.""",7

And that's pretty much what I received! It's fun, it's entertaining, it's quite witty in some places. The setting is beautiful, the actors are great, and there's a variety of characters to enjoy. I do not think this film is perfect-- far from it, in fact. Some of the characters (mostly male) are one-dimensional, not to mention there are a number of historical inaccuracies in the movie... however, overall, I am still happy with it!There are a lot of people who hate this movie for pushing a feminist agenda. However, it did not bother me at all. I did not even THINK about the feminism in this movie until I read the reviews online. There are feminist elements in the movie, but none of the ideas are radical nor tasteless. And a lot of the political ideas in the movie are extremely outdated, so it's difficult to be angry at them (unless there are people today who still expect women to wear corsets?)Overall, I think it's a good movie. I wouldn't watch it expecting some mystery masterpiece, but it's great if you're just looking for some fun :)""",8

So empty, so luscious.
Specially i hate play of this Natalie Portman clone which trying so hard to display that she is definitely not a character but a very, even overly talented teen actor which is so pro in grimacing. She is overplayed like every second of it. Jim Carrie - not less.
This movie in some strange way insults me as a watcher. I mean, why creators of this thinks so bad of watchers that they allowed this exist? Cant recall that i hated any other movie this much. Let me think... oh i hated ""the shape of water"" almost like this one. But this is much worse actually. It is worse than any avengers movie.

Richard_Vine,"""Rather a strange, disjointed film""",28 September 2020,"""Overall it is a film of its time. In other words a politically correct film that ignores the era in which it is supposedly set and plods along its own 21st century path with plenty of 19th century CGI backdrops.
The continual breaking of the Fourth Wall by the lead character is annoying. Since we all know that the film has no relationship with real life, past or present, it is irritating to have someone tapping on the lens shouting, ""This isn't real, you know!"" The audience worked that out very quickly.
While the leads, Enola and Tewksbury have some screen credibility, the remainder are very one dimensional. Mycroft is a scowling dolt, Sherlock is no brighter but has a nice smile, mother is barking mad, most of Tewksbury's family should be locked into the same asylum. We are also given the token black woman who adds nothing to the story other than tick another box on the director's list.
Please, please don't even think about making Enola II.
I'm sure there is a political statement behind the name and Enola Gay but I can't quite figure what it is.""",2

I highly recommend this movie to young adults - and, those young at heart. When the news is filled with stories that can drag one's spirits down - watch Enola Holmes to have them lifted up - at least for 2hrs. Enjoy!""",9

As a youth and a girl living with the conformities the society has set out for me, I knew exactly how she felt because there were also times when I went through the same experiences as her. It showed how much the community we live in needs so much change. There are people who don't seek for change because they are one of the beneficiaries who indulge themselves even if it is not for the betterment of many. It motivated me to speak up even when the world is shutting me down, to move under a limited space so others can thrive and to go out of the box I have been caving myself in. This is something people don't usually realize but because of this movie, I was able to do so. As cliche as it may sound, but Enola Homes changed a part of my life and how I view things were definitely changed into a better perspective. This movie is meant to give a positive message about becoming your own version and not letting society standards dictate what you should be doing.I hope other people will also be able to watch this because, Im sure that they will also learn a lot about themselves, our society and the things that they can do for the future ahead us.""",10
kristoffer-46,"""A great Holmes story!""",9 October 2020,"""Plot:
Enola Holmes set out on a journey to find out what happened to her mother who has gone missing. Her oldest brother Mycroft Holmes have other plans for her however as he wants her to be a proper lady and stop living the ""wild"" lifestyle influenced by their mother. The middle child Sherlock Holmes stands in the middle of his two siblings as he cares for them both, and has never been the best at emotions in general. We follow Enola Holmes on her first adventure on her own as she defies Mycroft and sets out to find her mother, only to come across another mystery who might very well change history itself.
Verdict:
I really do not understand how a movie lover cannot like this movie. If you want to read a proper Sherlock Holmes story then I suggest you turn your screen off and read one of the many stories written by Sir. Arthur Conan Doyle himself. This is not a Sherlock Holmes story. This is another take on the Holmes universe which keeps some characters and adds some other. This is the story about Enola Holmes. It is a mystery story about bravery, differences, society expectations & finding yourself and holding on to who you are. I thought it was a delight to see the Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown as the lead actress in this movie and she made a great and convincing performance as the younger sister of the iconic Mycroft & Sherlock characters. Henry Cavil does a fresh take as now side character Sherlock and speaking of the cast it would be wrong not to acknowledge the actress legend Helen Bonham Carter who plays the role as the mother Eudoria Holmes. Millie Brown & Bonham Carter stole every scene they had together and it was a delight to watch.
I thought this was an exciting, funny and fresh Holmes movie that was entertaining from the beginning to the end.8/10""",8

GWReviewDabbler,"""Holmes: ""Is that comforter on your bed?"" Watson: ""No, sheet, Sherlock""""",9 October 2020,"""A Netflix film starring the ever-rising star of Millie Bobbie Brown and the reliable and talented pair of Henry Cavill and Sam Claflin. What could go wrong?Honestly, nothing - it is a thoroughly enjoyable film. It's not going to tax your brain, it's not going to worry you and scare you, it's a fun, who dun it, starring some very talented and likeable actors, well-written, sometimes amusing, some adventure, some mystery, it has got a Saturday evening written all over it! Sit down with a bag of Minstrels (or chocolate of your choice), a nice cup of tea or Cream Soda and Ice Cream (sorry going back to my childhood treat there!) and just enjoy the film.Millie Bobby Brown plays the lesser known Holmes - Enola, younger sister of Sherlock and Mycroft who embarks on a mission to find something important to her that's gone missing, whilst avoiding her guardian Mycroft, the more arrogant and less caring elder brother - played brilliantly by the normally likable Mr Claflin and trying to emulate her slightly Superman looking but more caring and definitely elementary pointing out brother Sherlock - Mr Cavill, showing his more tender older brother side whilst maintaining Sherlock's dignity and sensibleness.Along the way, she meets the young Viscount Tewkesbury, who has problems of his own, namely in the form of Burn Gorman's Linthorn - seriously it seems that if you ever need a hard-eyed bad guy, who is silently threatening then Burn Gorman is there to get to the job - he does these roles incredibly well, his family who are out looking for him, including Frances de la Tour as his Dowager (I can't help but think of Maggie Smith every time I hear the word Dowager now - Downton has a lot to answer for!) Grandmother and Fiona Shaw as Miss Harrison, who is blatantly the much more horrid ancestor of her character in Three Men and Little Lady.Millie Bobby Brown is superb and it is amazing that someone of her talent and screen presence is still only 16 and even more amazing is that I didn't know that she is British - she did such a great accent, I had to look it up and was surprised to find the reason she does such a great British accent is that she has British parents, even though she has moved around a fair bit. There are times during the film when Enola either makes little comments to or looks at the audience and from some actresses that could be annoying but she imbues it with a sense of charm and humour. This is one young lady with a huge, huge future ahead of her and well-deserved so far!It sets itself up nicely for a second film and both Miss Brown and director Harry Bradbeer both want to make a second one, I can only hope Netflix green lights it - though they can make odd decisions - cancelling The Dark Crystal series anyone!Sit down this weekend, crack open the chocolates and 1980's style drinks and sit back and watch Sherlock's lesser known sister take centre stage - was this a resounding success - No ship Sherlock it was (sorry couldn't resist - I nearly made it to the end though)(writing ship really reminds me of Die Hard's yippee ki yay kimosabe and I'm kind of disappointed with my self-editing - but had to be done as this is a family friendly blog!Oh yeah a really fun and enjoyable 16/20 from me - even Shell enjoyed it, so you know it's got to be good.""",8

But in the most important part, it took some liberty in rewriting bits to make it a more empowering story for young women. And why not? It's a fantasy story for youngsters.It tells a young person to define oneself and to fight for the weak. It has a little bit of mystery, adventure, action. It adds a little bit of romantic touch to the plot. And it has a talented cast who committed to the characters and the story. That's pretty much I'd ask back in my early-teens.BTW, there is an abundant of even more absurd young films and fictions available. If you have problem with this one being girl-oriented, there are more than enough for you out there. Simply move on to find yourself another tree.As a used-to-be Holmes fan, the biggest nitpick for me is Mycroft. Mycroft is dumb down a lot so he can be a villainous character here (The canon books describes him to be even better in deduction than Shelock.

However, excited to see Millie Bobby Brown in another role, I began watching with a fresh mind, and I was definitely pleasantly surprised: I enjoyed how it was feminist yet didn't overdo it and portrayed feminism in the most realising and heartfelt way.

As a youth and a girl living with the conformities the society has set out for me, I knew exactly how she felt because there were also times when I when through the same experiences as her. It showed how much the community we live in needs so much change. There are people who don't seek for change because they are one of the beneficiaries who indulge themselves even if it is not for the betterment of many. It motivated me to speak up even when the world is shutting me down, to move under a limited space so others can thrive and to go out of the box I have been caving myself in. This is something people don't usually realize but because of this movie, I was able to do so. As cliche as it may sound, but Enola Homes changed a part of my life and how I view things were definitely changed into a better perspective. This movie is meant to give a positive message about becoming your own version and not letting society standards dictate what you should be doing.I hope other people will also be able to watch this because, Im sure that they will also learn a lot about themselves, our society and the things that they can do for the future ahead us.""",10

Now, they're likely hoping for a sequel where I would assume some of this stuff would be addressed. But again, I think it would have been better to draw it out over a series, or cut something out and introduce it later on. Some of the mysteries/conflicts felt a little rushed.I don't generally like narration in films. I find it usually a lazy way to get exposition across. But it actually didnt bug me that much in this. Especially Millie making faces at the camera, I think it added to her ""spunky"" nature. I think it could have been toned down a bit. Especially in scenes with other characters, cause there was 1 or maybe 2 times where I said ""Was she saying that to them, or was that for us"" and then of course when others wouldnt react to her comment I would be like ""Ok for us then"". And overall, let us figure out stuff too.If you're looking for a more serious and cerebral Holmes movie, I dont think this will be for you. This definitely is geared more towards teens/families. Which isnt a bad thing, I still thought it was fun. But to just to keep in mind.I thought all the actors did a really good job. Millie was the standout of course and was very likable throughout. Henry's Sherlock was a tad...boring. I felt like his character kind of took a backseat to the rest which on one hand kind of makes sense since he isnt the main character but also kind of weird since in this universe he is made out to be a super impressive famous guy, but we really dont see much as to why. But again, things to explore in a sequel. Louis Partridge (who kind of reminds me of a young Ben Barnes) was good with what was given, but I feel like he was thrown in there mainly to fill that teenage heartthrob quota.But if they do make a sequel, I would check it out.

gtessarini,"""The smartest sister of Sherlock Holmes""",30 September 2020,"""Enola Holmes, the younger sister of the famous detective Sherlock Holmes is an intrepid protagonist of the new Netflix production that bears his name. Filled with a youthful freshness, the film is capable of bringing us an invigorating version of the fantastic stories of deductions in an older century.Unlike the brilliant and fictional British researcher created in the 19th century by the writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Enola is younger in fiction and in reality. The story that introduces the teenage character to the literature published in 2006 by the American author Nancy Springer.The character's youth in no way detracts from her cleverness. Enola is trained in different fighting styles, versed in various literature, with a spontaneous desire for investigations and for establishing her own free personality. In the story, Enola Holmes has to escape the rigid control and harshness of her older siblings while searching for her mother who has mysteriously disappeared.Getting involved in restrictive issues of social classes and sexism, characteristics of the time when the story takes place, but unfortunately, also today, a character is attracted to a dangerous political plot and to a young and platonic novel.Even though it is a production more geared towards the teen audience, the work pleases different ages with its action-packed narrative, mental and fun exercises that Enola can perform, standing out even his famous older brother, Sherlock Holmes, solving a difficult case before him.Although it diminishes some of its own innovative strength with a youth novel built very quickly - literally, in just a single afternoon, Enola already repeatedly exposes how much the romantic interest grows in her head - mistake and success of many productions in that same style, the film has a very efficient construction.Positive point for the temporal work that works on the pillars of the young character's self-knowledge and the discovery of the vast world that she always read about and prepared to explore, but had never really ventured, although she felt no fear during this adventure dangerous to which it is taken.In the script, in the setting of the scenes and costumes, and especially in the great and energetic performance of Millie Bobby Brown who also produces a work, the Netflix film based on the work of writer Nancy Springer is a plot really worthy of detective stories and with a lot of feminine empowerment, action, fun and current reflections.""",8

She pulls of the dialogue particularly light comedy like a pro.Sam Claflin makes Mycroft distinctly unlikeable and does a good job with his part. As other reviewers say Henry Cavill is ok but miscast really. He's an actor I like but I would imagine someone like James Mcavoy would've suited it better and pulled off those little oddities and eccentricity that defines Sherlock.All the other cast members are good. It has a very English feel and has that kind of quality BBC period comedy drama feel. Netflix seem to be snapping up those features that could've bombed badly in a theatrical release not because they're bad films but don't have the tent pole budgets and action set pieces that only seem to attract cinema goers these days.It's an enjoyable romp with a fairly sound plot and enough detective work and sleuthing to satisfy.

Clearly the movie is not meant to be 100% historically accurate, movies rarely are, and it is meant to show that period of time in a more lighthearted way than we're generally used to, obviously women had to struggle a lot more and they had to endure way worse than what we're shown in the movie but that is because the social fight isn't meant to be the centre of the plot. The main point of the plot is still the mystery, first her mother's disappearance mystery then the mystery around the marquis attemped murder, which are both strictly linked to the historical context. I'd say the movie's setting would be around 1918, when in the UK the male electorate was extended to include all men over 21. I genuinely enjoyed the movie, finally a 16 years old character interpreted by an actual 16 years old actress, it is a playful and somehow comedic way to introduce the social issues of the time to a larger audience, usually movies that revolve around social injustice fights (especially women's rights) are meant for an older audience, but in this case we have a badass heroine in a PG-13 movie that still tackles interesting social fights.

She certainly makes you cheer hard for Enola to solve the case but also to remain an independent young woman. You also have some great performances by Henry Cavill and Helena Bonham Carter to name a few.Enola is the sister of Sherlock Holmes, and their uptight, regimental older brother, Mycroft Holmes. Enola's only desire is to find her mother, who has gone missing. Mycroft's only desire is to put Enola in a finishing school.Enola sets off on her own, as a young and inexperienced 16-year-old girl, armed only with the knowledge that her mother has passed down to her: knowledge in history, chemistry, literature, and even physical combat. Enola is already blessed with keen deductive reasoning skills that make even Sherlock grin with pride.While the case sets Enola off in search of her mother, she quickly becomes side-tracked with a much more important case.Those insecure little boys who've complained that the film is too ""Feministic"" or ""not historically accurate"" are those who can't enjoy the story for what it is. The movie is NOT supposed to be based on history! And, yes, the movie is a strong take on the capabilities of women not being inferior to men. If you have a problem with either of these things, then don't watch it. I love emotional cowards who are unable to deal with the power of women.

The feminist message is as subtle as the clichés of Victorian England, strong-willed women and fourth-wall breaks that are regurgitated at the audience at every possible opportunity, to the point of tedium. Liberal reinterpretations and adaptations of Conan Doyle's beloved character can be and have been artfully and cleverly done, but the supposed sister of the legendary Sherlock and Mycroft in this version is simply a pretty martial arts dilettante who dabbles a little in word puzzles and relies on the gauche, predictable and transparent plot, rather than intellectual prowess or observation, to solve mysteries no more challenging than those tackled by the Famous Five. Her opponents are cut-out caricatures rather than anything against which she can really test her mettle. From a movie with a feminist message in 2020 I expect more than Mary Poppins with an uppercut and a couple of famous relatives.

Holt344,"""Enola Holmes has a large entertainment factor and good acting behind itself, but lacks in a satisfying second half""",23 September 2020,"""Millie Bobby Brown is Enola Holmes, her performance was great, energetic and overall interesting to watch, I've heard so many good things about her performance in Stranger Things but I can only tell from this movie and she was incredible in the role as the intelligent young Enola Holmes. The story has her on a mission to find her mother who disappeared, she takes help from her two brothers Sherlock and Mycroft but she ends up doing it alone and it was the right thing for Enola Holmes to do. The character is interesting and intelligent, the dialogue is on point and overall writing was perfect for her. In my opinion the first half was great and the second not so good but the acting of the three Holmes siblings made it entertaining.Henry Cavill plays Sherlock Holmes and he did an amazing job, I want to see him get a spin-off movie. Henry Cavill amazes me again and again. So did Sam Claflin, his performance as the older brother Mycroft was strong and believable. I can say that the movie was rightfully cast, maybe Lestrade was the only one that was lacking but it was the writing for the character that was off and not the actor. Lord Tewksbury was a character I didn't really like, maybe it was the huge presence the actor had in the movie, there's nothing wrong with him but I felt the movie would have worked better without a love interest.The editing is great and fast paced which makes the story move very fast, it isn't for everyone but it works with Millie's energetic performance and the feel-good atmosphere that the film has.
The writing isn't great but it ain't bad either, it's okey. Some could argue that Enola breaking the fourth wall doesn't have a place in the movie but let me make an argument that it works for the movie, right from the start we get to know that Enola is alone and likes her own company and that can lead to the said person talking to herself. Bear with me here, I find it great that there is a huge amount of feminism in this movie but there's too much of it at times, now there were feminism in that time but it feels like there's too much of it in some scenes which makes it unrealistic but it's an entertaining movie that a lot of people could watch and enjoy.This isn't one of those incredible movies that leaves you mind blown, it doesn't try to be that kinda movie. Instead, it's a fun adventure movie for the whole family, a Netflix Original for all ages. Millie Bobby Brown did a great performance and so did Henry Cavill and Sam Claflin. There's more books and stories with Enola Holmes and I will tune in again if we get a sequel.""",7

None of the characters were really fleshed out well. And there was some comedy but not enough to entertain. Similair wise, there was some romance, but not enough to become invested in it.

Constantly breaking the 4th wall got tedious. And there's not so much to tell apart from the appreciated feminist undertone.

phoenixinvictus,"""I found it boring and a waste of good actors""",1 October 2020,"""Both Sherlock and Mycroft are out of character, incompetent and the movie portrays them as arrogant misogynists. Neither Sherlock nor Mycroft recognize their little sister when they reach the station. This is Sherlock Holmes who can tell you what you had for breakfast last week and Mycroft whose genius surpasses that of Sherlock can't tell who their sister is? I'm not buying it. If they wanted to make Enola the hero then fine but at least don't distract the audience by directly talking to them, winking, or explaining everything. Almost all the attention is placed upon Enola, and they still drop the ball in character building. The Holmes brothers are useless and it is quite obvious that Mycroft has a secret (yet not so secret) love interest for the abusive teacher Miss Harrison. In spite of what the writers want you to think, Enola Holmes just isn't Sherlock Holmes. The storytelling is mediocre at best and the sheer amount of unnecessary scenes is staggering that most of it doesn't make logical sense. The fight scenes are comical and the villain who fights Enola is so one dimensional. Enola is obviously intelligent and possesses a vast amount of knowledge, but in the end, she didn't solve the case. She didn't solve anything without Sherlock's help and yet she gets the credit.""",1

The shame of it is that this rendition could have been filmed with the characters intact. If there are more productions in this franchise I will NOT be watching them.""",1
maanikroda,"""Pithy light steps.""",25 September 2020,"""Enola Holmes isn't a carbon copy of the different versions of Sherlock Holmes we've seen in the movies & series, but it boasts the same pithy, modernized light step. It may not be quite as visibly bold as them, but screenwriter Jack Thorne and director Harry Bradbeer did a wonderful job of capturing that same thinking-out-loud visual aesthetic that turns exposition into more of a snack than a chore. Both Enola Holmes and its rising young star, Stranger Things' Millie Bobby Brown, effortlessly radiate charm in a tale about Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes' rebellious teen sister, a gifted super-sleuth in search of her missing mother. Millie; who already has become world's favorite, takes the entire movie on her shoulders effortlessly and while other cast members don't have a lot to do, they all seem to have done their jobs perfectly including the flawless Henry Cavill who portrayed Sherlock Holmes & many other cast members whom we've seen in Harry Potter movies including Helena Bonham Carter & Fiona Shaw.In the era of intellectual property in which studios are mining their own libraries to repackage the same branded concepts over and over, I found myself unexpectedly enjoying Enola Holmes despite our increasing cultural exhaustion with the property. The fourth-wall-breaking asides become tiresome at a point and the mystery isn't quite as fetching as the film thinks it is (nor is the puppy love romantic dynamic sprinkled throughout). But the movie stands tall when its major lead; ENOLA played by Millie Bobby Brown denounces her provincial older brothers by accurately pointing out that they don't wish to change the world because the world suits them as is.

man14,"""Bad. So Bad. Too Bad.""",24 September 2020,"""I am a Sherlock Holmes fan. Always have been. So when I read that a new Sherlock Holmes related film (albeit about his less known and much younger sister Enola) was being released, I got excited. Big mistake.
Now, my problem isn't with the female character driven plot (I'm a huge fan of the Underworld or Hunger Games franchises, to name but two). Not even with the fact that Sherlock Holmes has very little screen time - I knew that from the start. No, my problem is with the fact that this film has no story - only a series of excuses to show women kicking men's asses. That's it, that's the whole film. My problem is with the fact that this film treats the audience like idiots, as if anyone in their right mind and a minimum knowledge of History would believe that the things they show in this sad excuse of a film were actually possible in the England of the late 1800's. Now, I'm all for the advancement of women's place in society and History, I'm all for it - but this is the wrong way to do it. Making films where all the men are either idiots or evil and only the women are capable and good is the wrong way to do it, not only because it's unrealistic but because it doesn't make for a good story.
There were - and are - real female heroes who, throughout History and today, fought and fight bravely for women's rights without throwing a single punch or making enemies out of men; Hollywood should tell their stories instead of making drivel like this or the more recent version of Charlie's Angels. It's a pity, really. With a decent story line and character development, it could have been a decent addition to the Holmes canon.
My advice to all who haven't seen it is: avoid it like the plague. Watch the Granada series from the 1980's with Jeremy Brett as the best Holmes ever instead. Or the more recent Sherlock or Elementary. Hell, even the two RDJ Sherlock Holmes films are preferable to this. You're very welcome.""",3

Traditionalists were certainly within their righteousness to claim that times had never been better, yet equity in the vote, as most of us now know, was certainly the more noble cause.

With little to do the well-liked and talented performers provide a welcome presence to the film but don't provide much of any substance, perhaps it would've been wise for the film to allow Brown and Cavill in particular more time together in the narrative as you can sense the relationship between these two talented siblings could've provided a real spark to the films mediocre story.Final Say -A family film that does what it promises to do but in a mostly uninspired fashion, Enola Holmes is a great showcase for Millie Bobby Brown but this new take on the Holmes name will need a far more memorable outing next time around if its to become a long lasting addition to the brand.2 1/2 suitcases out of 5""",5

And as a family movie it was a solid one.I was a bit sceptical on Henry Cavill playing Sherlock, due to his sheer size. But I was proven wrong, and once again confermed in his ability and range as an actor.
Millie really shows that she is one to look out for in the future, and I'm sure we'll get to see many fantastic movies with her as a lead actress!The only problems I had, hand on my heart, was that I felt a lack of exploration in the characters, and in the closing shot, they drive on the right side. The film is set in, I believe 1884, where as the law made it mandetory in England from 1835 to drive on the left hand side.

kerstin-meinen,"""You need to calm down""",29 September 2020,"""I honestly enjoyed watching this movie. Was it historically inaccurate? Sure. Do I care? Not at all. Is it very likely to have that amount of people of color as equal parts of society? Not very, but all it did was change the aesthetics and paint a picture of how the world should look like. I don't think, the goal was to make a historically accurate movie, to me it looks like it is a movie made for young people, to be fun and inspiring, which it is. I'm in my thirties and have a degree in history, but I choose to accept the bending of the setting to tell a story.Everyone trying to state, that the modern views and opinions have been shoved in to the wrong period of time seem to fall into the trap of believing that just because they were not heard, these women didn't exist. How do you think we got all the women artists pushing to be accepted in to art schools during the 19th centuries? The female scientists? The women pushing for the right to vote? The ideas were there, they were unfotunately not taken seriously and did not become adapted by everyone, yet. Please explain to me, how women got into postions and jobs not typically taken by females, if the idea of equality and independence did not exist in the 19th century.If you except a traditional Sherlock story, please take another look at the title: This is Enolas story, her point of view, her ideas. All of ot gets (initially) dismissed by her brothers and she sets out to do it her way anyway. Sounds to me like a very typical female story, regardless of the century.I liked Enolas commentary on what was happening, I enjoyed the sets and costumes, the acting, and only kind of understand the critique on the story telling. It felt a bit like a new tv series still searching for its footing, but still: The general feedback baffles me and makes me feel like there are two versions of this film.""",9

xpics,"""After a point you just don't care!""",28 September 2020,"""The pulling factor for me, like most other audience I presume, was Millie Bobby Brown - the girl who got famous as El in Stranger Things. Of course there was the Sherlock connection as well to look forward to. But after a while, Millie's charm could not pull off the lousy writing of the film and the Sherlock connection wasn't of the 'wow' variety either.The film starts with Enola in pursuit of her missing mother, who disappears one night without rhyme or reason. While that seems like an interesting hook point for a film, the pay off at the end is plain lackadaisical. Enola's brothers Sherlock and Mycroft come to her. Her relationship with both is strained and you just don't know why. Perhaps you are expected to do some homework and come prepared reading Sherlock history. Further the plot digresses to a young Prince running away from his royal family. And when this Prince is shot in the chest in the pre-climax and he pulls out his bullet-proof vest to show that he smartly saved himself, you know that the narrative has turned as formulaic and old as it's ancient setting.Despite the fact that search for her mother seems like a solemn conflict, the narrative is far from the serious tone and Enola remains lively and effervescent throughout. The mood is pretty upbeat. However the 'talking-to-camera' style of storytelling loses its effect when the makers overdo it. To its credit, the film oozes an old-world charm with its picturesque town, vintage train compartments, steam-engine running motor cars and ancient London setting. However the screenplay gets muddled with archiac subplots of a political conspiracy and a power-tussle in royal family formula.After a point you don't care for the characters or the story. Disappointing!""",4

rogier-86785,"""Feel Good Holmes""",24 September 2020,"""Enola Holmes is a side take on the original Sherlock Holmes story, featuring the younger teenage sister Enola of the Holmes family on a quest to discover herself and the world through a crime mystery.Broken down, the film is essentially a bright version of a Holmes investigation, looked at through the young and optimistic eyes of co-producer Millie Bobby Brown who also plays the lead role. Don't expect this to have the same dark tone as the original stories or the brilliantly brutal modern day version of BBC's Sherlock. It's a feel-good film and it knows it.The positives are that its well filmed, stooped in magical realism, has some tacky but outspoken music - a welcome rarity these days - and involves fun mysteries and some smart twists. Special shout out goes to the editors, who give the film a great tempo. The expert cast performs very well and I felt a real connection to the characters because of it.The mystery itself revolves around the theme of women fighting for their place in society and serves as a reminder that equality was as hard to find in days past as it still is sometimes today. This theme has arguably been portrayed a lot better in the Sherlock episode of The Abominable Bride, but it doesn't take away much from the message regardless, and gives a nice boost to the idea that we all create our own fate.Where the film begins to falter is the lack of stakes. Although enough danger happens, you never feel as if the characters are really fighting an uphill battle. The plot also feels too full at times, which is probably the youthful energy of its makers shining through. It's forgivable yes, but it does take away from the film.An immediately apparent flaw of the writers is that Sherlock is portrayed as a nice man, which is of course completely out of character. So nice in fact that it even sparked protest from the descendants of the original writer (Doyle). For us viewers it just feels like a missed opportunity. We can understand why Sherlock is softer here. But although Henry Cavill performs the character well, it would have been perfectly possible to give Sherlock a lot more bite, without ruining the intentions of the plot.I personally found it all elegantly done. In truth, it's more of a six, but the extra point to a seven I gave for its energy and daring. If the stakes had been higher, my score would've been higher too. But as it stands, a good debut behind the scenes for young Millie Bobby Brown, and she plays great in front of the camera too.Just be prepared: this is a feel-good Holmes story. And although entertaining, that will feel like a bit of a mystery in and out of itself.""",7

Movies_n_chill,"""Nice pass time""",24 September 2020,"""Brief introduction:
I was quite excited to watch this movie but did not go into it with a lot of expectations. The story begins with Enola introducing us to her life and how she was raised by her mother. Soon we come to know that the 'Holmes' siblings have united because there is a problem at hand. Each one of them is trying to deal with this newly arrived situation using the best of their capabilities. Enola , however has been brought up in a way where she can survive on her own and does not need to fit into the ideals that society has set up for woman in order to have a happy and successful future. She is thus unable to accept the reality of the situation and sets out on a mission to find out more for her self. Not everything goes as she hoped for but nonetheless she discovers a few important things about herself on the way which is great for her.
Review:
The story keeps moving with pace and we can see a lot of activity on screen. Despite being intriguing in itself,the film does lose grip on the viewers at times.Nevertheless the characters are likeable and well portrayed. The mystery is satisfying too.The depiction of Victorian England might not be very accurate but nonetheless it suits the narrative well.
Actors :
Millie Bobby Brown is very convincing and lovable in the role of a budding detective and almost gives her elder brother a competition in this department. Henry Cavell is charming as Sherlock Holmes and I liked the film's take on this legendary character. All the other actors have done good justice to their roles as well.
Overall:
The clues, ciphers and witty banters make the detective story quite enjoyable.Enola Holmes is sure to charm her way into your heart too just as she does with the characters in this film!""",8

I suggest we promote the creation of an Oscar for casting, just for this year, then forget all about it because we know this will probably never happen again.Oh yeah, there's also a story, screenplay, acting and whatever.

As a youth and a girl living with the conformities the society has set out for me, I knew exactly how she felt because there are also times when I go through the same experiences as her. It showed how much the community we live in needs so much change. There are people who don't seek for change because they are one of the beneficiaries who indulge themselves even if its not for the betterment of many. It motivated me to speak up even when the world is shutting me down, to move under a limited space so others can thrive and to go out of the box I have been caving myself in. This is something people don't usually realize but because of this movie, I was able to do so. As cliche as it may sound, but Enola Homes changed a part of my life and how I view things were definitely changed into a better perspective. This movie is meant to give a positive message about becoming your own version and not letting society standards dictate what you should be doing.I hope other people will also be able to watch this because, Im sure that they will also learn a lot about themselves, our society and the things that they can do for the future ahead of us.""",10

yongkang-27205,"""Felt more like a female empowerment film more than anything else""",29 September 2020,"""Throughout the whole film, Enola tries to break free from the social conformities of its time. This is then set against the backdrop of a sherlock homes esq mystery film. It did the female empowerment thing on point, really, stunning performance on that front. However, given that this was supposed to be more a mystery film, I did not expect this film to touch so little on that. There was a huge emphasis on Enola's struggles but it failed to make it relavent to the main storyline, even overshadowing it. Hence all I'll say is that if you're looking to watch a female empowerment film, this would be the one, but if you were like me looking to find the thrill of the mystery, keeping yourself at the edge of your seat to see the mystery solved, you will find yourself sorely disappointed.On that note, I will add that the acting and performance by the actors and actresses, especially millie, was most definitely a pleasant to watch.""",7

It felt fresh, unique and yet familiar at the same time.Millie Bobby Brown (who I'd previously never heard of) brings a lot of energy to her performance as Enola. The film itself has a lot of energy and enough 4th wall breaks to reel-in even the most sleepy of viewers. Millie certainly has a strong supporting cast working with her too - they're just rather underutilized. Henry Cavill gave one of the best portrayals of Sherlock Holmes I've seen.I still have no idea what that romantic interest boy's name was. But that's probably half the point. The men and boys here are just but a sideshow to Enola Holmes and the empowering themes for women throughout. I'm glad young women are getting more and more cinematic role models.While I wasn't the target audience, 'Enola Holmes' still kept me entertained, without being truly remarkable. I probably will have forgotten this by tomorrow, though I'm curious where a potential franchise of this goes.""",6
vandykeu,"""A fun movie""",26 September 2020,"""Don't let the bad reviews put you off this one. It's a fun movie, mainly about two young people figuring out who they are and what they want in life (primarily Enola, but I found Tewkesbury's journey interesting as well). The movie has a couple of strong inspirational messages:1) Don't let anyone but you decide how to live your life, no matter who you are.
2) Don't let your own expectations blind you to what is true, or right.Is it perfectly historical? Probably not, but I think it would be daft to assume that young women (and young men) didn't find themselves chafing under the expectations that have been laid out for them. Heck, they STILL DO in our modern age. And that's the real value of movies, and, more broadly, stories like this. 'That's just the way things are' is never sufficient reason to go along with how you are expected to live. We should always challenge such things in the name of equality and righteousness.""",8
amandadaley-27509,"""Loved it! Great for families with girls.""",26 September 2020,"""My little girl is only 8. There is some violence and scary parts, but she loved it. She laughed and cried and was absolutely captivated the whole time. She brought the movie up the next night at dinner because it'd been on her mind all day.I think this movie is good for girls of all ages. It is especially good for Moms and daughters. It is also good for men such as my husband because it is entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable,I'm disappointed with the 1/10 ratings by some men below. No, the writers do not need a history lesson. They were not oblivious to the constraints on women at the time. Actually, the attempt to tame and control Enola is quite central to the story. Yes, the movie does put modern day values onto a bygone era, but it is not historically inaccurate that some women of that time were radical and brilliant and willing to risk it all! The women of the suffrage movement were very brave and there have always been women doing amazing things, albeit sometimes they had to pretend to be men, as Enola does. Like others have said, this movie is not supposed to be a serious historical drama. It is meant to be lighthearted.I loved the mother daughter relationship. I loved their closeness. In the age of home learning because of COVID I bet a lot of parents could relate to this movie because the movie starts with scenes of intense home schooling. In our home, home learning was tough and there were long days when sometimes tears were shed. I've now also tried to teach her piano and guitar and we've been doing science experiments - making sun dials, thinking about density and forces and light. I've taught long division and fractions and I've made her do tasks repeatedly until she understood. It hasn't been easy for us. When watching this movie there are physical fight scenes between Mom and daughter which are the jiu jitsu lessons So, I asked my daughter, do you know why they're fighting? And she replied, because she wants her to learn. And, I said to her ""Now you understand me"" and in response I got the warmest snuggles on the couch. So, for us this movie helped bring a little healing, and it was fun to bond with my daughter over it.""",9

She made this movie a very fun and clever ride, full of women power and social activism. Also a big fan of Henry Cavill as Sherlock Holmes. I loved all the quips and the fight scenes were well executed. I thought that giving Enola a love interest in the young Lord was a bit cliché but I ended up growing to like their budding relationship. The mystery aspect of the movie was well done, what else could I expect from a Sherlock Holmes movie!

There were elements of drama and comedy sprinkled throughout and a rather stacked cast was headed by the magnificent Millie Bobby Brown. This movie only highlights that she is going to be a megastar within the film and television industry for decades to come. The only real cirticism I have is that the ending was rather abrupt. The storytelling was very intricate and layered throughout and everything just kind of came to an abrupt finale which seemed out of sorts with the rest of the film. Initially I was thinking they were setting up for a sequel and I wouldn't have been mad about that if they had but instead everything just concluded. Would highly recommend!!""",8
sianyemz1807,"""Lackin in places but made up for it by Millie Bobby Brown's fantastic acting""",24 September 2020,"""This film follows Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown), the astute younger sister of Sherlock (Henry Cavill) and Mycroft Holmes (Sam Claflin), on her journey to solve the mystery of her missing mother (Helena Bonham Carter) who disappears when she turns 16.Following in her mother's footsteps, Enola is tenacious and independent, and demonstrates her capability to find her own path and solve her problems and puzzles without the aid of her patronising older brothers. It was really refreshing to see such a strong-willed young female protagonist who didn't have to rely upon men to help her succeed.I have to say that Cavill as Sherlock is one of the worse castings I've ever seen. I don't think he could possibly have brought any less personality to the role if he tried. Claflin was slightly more engaging as Mycroft although still rather dull. Scenes with just the two of them were certainly not the most thrilling. I do feel the writers are also to blame here as they had the space to do something really awesome with these characters, but did not.Fortunately, Enola Holmes is so fantastic that her brothers were really not very important to her story. Brown outshone everyone else in this film beyond measure. She brought her own style of wit and charismatic charm to the role which certainly made up for areas of the film which were lacking. Enola breaking the fourth wall throughout gave even more of an opportunity for Brown to captivate the audience which she did spectacularly.This story is aimed at a slightly younger audience than previous Sherlock Holmes movies and makes for a great family film. Although at times some of the mysteries feel a bit lost, and parts of the storyline and dialogue are a little cheesy, it remains a fast-paced, entertaining and enjoyable movie.""",6

Couldn't the producers of this barely entertaining film have come up with a better hook on which to hang the plot? Stopping a serial killer or foiling a heist of the Bank of England, for example. The only redeeming value of this film is the presence of a semi-grownup Millie Bobby Brown who isn't bleeding from the nostrils. The actor who plays Mycroft Holmes is too small by far for the part. And the writers portray a Sherlock Holmes who lacks the perception and wit of the classic character. Enola's asides to the audience are meant to be cute -- and even funny, perhaps -- but they are neither. So, this is a film to see if your taste runs to irrelevant ""message"" movies.""",4
benjaminpizarrosalinas,"""There's a little bit of movie in your feminist propaganda""",24 September 2020,"""I'm a Sherlock Holmes fan, so I was excited when they announced this movie.... And I got disappointed so fast...
First the acting. Nothing remarcable. They were just average. And Millie Bobby Brown didn't shine as I thought she would.
The characters are charmless. I couldn't care for anyone... They're woods, no emotions or goals, only fake crying sometimes.
Now the environments were.... Good. Just nice portrait of London, with a few cringy CGI scenes. But it's pasable.
Now the plot. Ow the plot.
The main idea is simple, Enola's mom went missing. So after finding some clues, she goes to find her. It sound good on paper, but it's not good when you watch it...
There are sooo many ""convinient"" things in the movie to helped the plot, that's very lazy...
And what's worse, the movie is ment to be a feminist propaganda, yup. And I know it's okay to show that sometimes, it's important and it's necessary. But the WHOLE thing is about feminism. Later in the movie we figure that Enola's mom is a radical feminist, yes. And she abandoned Enola to join her group of radicals to do a terrorist attack, to show women needs the right to vote and change the world. A terrorist attack that was going to kill people as they showed it in the movie. And what's worst, some people like Enola or Sherlock figured this, but they didn't care. They said ""it might be dangerous"" once, but that's all. After that they continued their lives without caring... An terrorist attack
Okay... I can go on an on talking about the problems with the propaganda in this movie, but I could make a whole review about that, so I'll move to something else.
Let's talk about the characters we now (as Sherlock, Mikroft, and even Lestrad). They're all morons.
Mikroft is an anti feminist guy, so the movie makes him one of the main antagonists. Oh boy
Now Lestrad. He's just useless, seriously. As the chief(I guess) of Scotland Yard, he should be capable of much more. But he can barely catch Enola. And that's all, he's just useless
Now Sherlock. He's just a shadow of what he's supposed to be. They said he solved a lot of cases, they said he's know by everyone by his wisdom and habilities. But he got, literally, beaten by Enola solving the main case. Beaten by a 16 yo that has no knowledge on solving cases, that doesn't know ANYTHING about human behavior (she literally spent her whole life in her house without leaving, just with her mom and her maid). How did this happened?There are a lot of negative points I'm missing in this review, but it would make this eternal. As an advise, if you like the Sherlock Holmes of the books, maybe the one played by Benedict Cumberbatch, or even the one in that Tom & Jerry's crossover, don't watch this. It doesn't do justice to it's legendary characters.
If You're a hardcore Sherlock fan, and you can miss all it's flaws, Enola Holmes can be an entertaining Romantic ""Mystery"" movie. In any other case, skip this...""",3

Soon we are told that she is 16. If my math is correct 1884 plus 16 is 1900, and this is underscored by the fact that we see Enola riding a bicycle typical of c. 1900.Soon, however, it becomse apparent that the costuming is wrong for 1900. Big bustled dresses are typical of 1884, and then an important plot point regarding the Third Reform and Redistribution Act of 1884 enters the storyline, and we even see Sherlock is reading a newspaper dated 1884. How can a multi-million dollar production make such an egregious error as to suggest she is born the very year the story takes place?The writing is thin, very thin. The plot is predictable and pointless, the women are made to look smarter than men by writing the men as stupid. Meanwhile, her mother is at the source of a plot that could kill hundreds of people, and she is written as some sort of feminist heroine.What is a shame is that the talent was there - the idea for the film is brilliant, the actors hired were good choices, but the writing, editing, and direction are substandard.""",4
hunter-friesen,"""""Enola Holmes"" is clever fun""",27 September 2020,"""Over the years we've heard a lot of stories about the famed detective Sherlock Holmes. In fact, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's deerstalker wearing sleuth holds the record for the most portrayals of a literary character at 254.While Sherlock has dominated the mystery genre for over a century, a new part of the Holmes family is finally getting their due. The newest Netflix movie (there seems to be a new one every day) follows the adventures of the younger sister of Sherlock and Mycroft, named Enola Holmes.Enola was born years after her famous brothers and never quite got to know them or her prematurely deceased father. She spent her entire childhood with only her mother as company. Together, they read books, played indoor sports, conducted science experiments, and acted out plays. Despite her name being ""alone"" spelled backward, Enola always had her mother by her side to show her the wonders of the world.On her sixteenth birthday, Enola wakes up to the unpleasant surprise of her mother suddenly disappearing without a word. She calls in her brothers to help solve the mystery. They arrive with dismay about how Enola has been raised and cast her aside thinking she won't be of much aid. Needing to prove to her brothers that she's a capable young woman, Enola sets out to find her mother and beat them at their own game.Like the locomotive train that contains one of the movie's great set pieces, ""Enola Holmes"" is a well-oiled machine that runs at a rapid pace. The film carries an infectiously rambunctious energy to it, much of which comes from its star.Already a two-time Emmy nominee for her role as Eleven in ""Stranger Things"", Millie Bobby Brown is perfectly cast as our titular character. She never misses a beat with her comedic timing and carries the film almost solely on her shoulders. She also brings great skill to the emotional moments.Director Harry Bradbeer also contributes to the gleeful tone by doing what he does best. Similar to his work in the critically acclaimed ""Fleabag"", Bradbeer has his heroine break the fourth wall and talk directly into the camera. It's a fun tactic that never wears its welcome and allows for Brown to showcase her amazing talent.Things take a surprisingly dark turn once Enola arrives in London as she gets tangled with hitmen and a radical plot to bomb the House of Lords. For a supposed kids film, there is quite a bit of violence towards our younger characters.The home of Big Ben looks more drab and crowded than ever as cinematographer Giles Nuttgens beautifully contrasts the cramped and intimidating metropolis with the lush and vibrant countryside.What does bring down ""Enola Holmes"" from time to time is its predictable central mystery. If you're a veteran of Sherlock Holmes or the mystery genre, it won't be too hard to figure out what will happen next. The film also tries to weave in bits of social commentary about gender and class throughout. Unfortunately, the messaging is half-baked and creates jarring breaks from the whimsical tone.Even though Brown is clearly the star, the well-rounded supporting cast also shines in their roles.Superman himself Henry Cavill plays the iconic detective. Still with his Man of Steel physique, Cavill plays Sherlock closer to James Bond as his suave charisma brings a welcome departure from his dour performances in the DC films.Sam Claflin, most famous for playing Finnick in ""The Hunger Games"" films, is downright dastardly as the uptight Mycroft Holmes. Complete with a twirling mustache and tophat, Claflin offers a harsh counterbalance to Brown's exuberance.Finally, Helena Bonham Carter is inspirational as the eccentric mother of the Holmes trio. She brings the same out-of-the-box energy one would expect from her and hits the emotional depths required.With a star-making performance from its leading lady and a healthy dose of energy, ""Enola Holmes"" is a charming mystery for (nearly) all ages. Based on the way it ends, a sequel could be on its way in the near future; one that would be well deserved.""",7

I'm still midway, savouring, adventuring, loving every minute & delaying the end of my journey! Catch this one on Netflix!

ginocox-206-336968,"""Self-indulgent feminist fantasy fulfillment with a healthy dose of misandry""",4 October 2020,"""Enola Holmes is about 60% self-indulgent feminist fantasy fulfillment, 20% buddy-pic/road-trip, 10% mystery, and 10% 1970s made-for-television-style action/adventure. Somewhere in there, they manage to set the groundwork for a sequel or franchise.The MacGuffin is an impending Parliamentary vote of critical import to the women's suffrage movement, the Representation of the People Act 1884, which was actually passed four years before the setting of the movie and didn't extend voting rights to women. Various villainous types are adamantly opposed to its passage, while a shadowy group of radical feminists seem prepared to go all Guy Fawkes for reasons and in a manner that are never made clear. Neither group has motives that make much sense. The opponents could have expressed concern that most women were not educated, or that few paid taxes, so shouldn't dictate how government revenues were allocated. Instead, they are portrayed as shallow misogynists intent on preserving the status quo by subjugating women. With such shallow villains, the protagonists seem equally vapid, insisting women's suffrage is the way of the future. The lord who will cast the deciding vote does so for no other reason than that his father would have done so.Enola Holmes joins a long procession of recent films that prioritize political pandering over plot and character development. Initially, the film seems to handle its socio-political message fairly adroitly, but it quickly devolves into a constant onslaught of feminist propaganda, delivered with a healthy measure of misandry. Sherlock (Henry Cavill) is given little to do and little of what he does drives the plot. Neither Sherlock nor Enola (Millie Bobby Brown) demonstrate brilliant powers of observation and deduction by weaving obscure clues into a convincing tapestry of irrefutable logic. Enola has read every book in a sizeable private library, including the encyclopædia, but never draws upon her supposedly vast knowledge of medicine, engineering, chemistry, physics or any other science. About all she does is solve anagrams, which in real life don't always have unique solutions, as with bowel/below, so seem of dubious value in detection or encryption.In many respects, Enola is a fairly typical heroic protagonist: A precocious intellectually-gifted Übermensch, privately tutored by a sensei with an unconventional approach to education, financially independent, adept at one or more forms of martial arts, et cetera. Her youth and gender consign her to a smaller, but hardly exclusive, group of amateur female sleuths. Enola hardly distinguishes herself by her deductive skill, which is barely displayed.There are two striking contrasts between Enola and, say, Modesty Blaise. First is her aggressive, relentless feminism, which seems to color nearly everything she says or does. Most heroes display a certain benevolence toward all victims, possibly with a Robin Hood-esque propensity. Enola is more narrow-minded and selfish, with a generous streak of misandry. When she realizes the marquess is in imminent peril, her first impulse is to throw him to the dogs to save her own skin. She takes no interest in him and his troubles until she realizes he could be helpful in achieving her own objectives.Second is Enola's physical appearance, which is the polar opposite of Monica Vitti as Modesty Blaise or Farrah Fawcett as Jill Munroe. She isn't ugly by any stretch of the imagination, but neither is she strikingly gorgeous. Her facial features are somewhat boyish, a trait she exploits on several occasions by disguising herself as a boy. Miss Harrison disparages her measurements as not being sufficiently feminine. Physically, she is what might be described as a chick-flick protagonist - attractive, but not so beautiful as to seem like competition to the soccer moms in the audience. She is a protagonist for an age when plus-size models adorn the cover of Sports Illustrated, swimsuit competitions are abandoned by beauty pageants, and a transsexual is chosen as Playboy's Playmate of the Month.But the film goes beyond casting a girl-next-door as the romantic lead, to a deliberate, almost aggressive rejections of traditional notions of femininity and masculinity. Her romantic lead is a baby-faced boy with long hair who is unattached and inexperienced, despite being one of the most eligible bachelors in England. When she catches him gazing at her in admiration, she admonishes him not to look at her. The closest they get to an impassioned embrace is exchanging looks through an iron gate, with him on the side representing power and influence, and her symbolically excluded. He can prepare a seven-course vegetarian feast from wild plants, but is oblivious to the palace intrigues that surround him.The writer and filmmakers could have taken a positive approach, with Enola and Sherlock each using their powers of observation and deduction to solve the mystery. They could have independently arrived at the same solution, showing that a woman can be just as effective as a man. Or, they each could have been stymied until they relied upon one another to solve the case together. Instead, the filmmakers embraced a much darker, more negative narrative.Women, other than those like Enola and her mother, are unable to succeed because they are exploited by men. At worst, men are insidious misogynistic villains intent on exploiting women; at best, useful idiots. Suffrage and feminism are seen as zero-sum games, rather than empowering women to achieve more - giving women a larger share of an existing pie, rather than enabling them to make the pie larger. The purpose is not to improve attitudes, or to provide the educational opportunities that will enable women to achieve their full potential, but to seize power through legislation, or, if necessary, violently.Feminists are critical of toxic masculinity, but this film has strong undercurrents of toxic feminist attitudes.""",4

It's not realistic either in the way the story unfolds but is still as easy to follow as a documentary. It's fun, colourful and adventurous in quite a quaint old-fashioned way.

sweidman-28016,"""Exceeds Expectations""",14 October 2020,"""""Sometimes you must dangle your feet in the water in order to attract the sharks.""A Netflix movie aimed for teens and younger audiences actually turned out decent. Personally this movie didn't interest me because of this ideology that it would turn out as another disappointing and pointless movie. Plus we've had enough Sherlock Holmes movies and spinoffs. But there's a charm to this one. That's mainly due to the characters. Milly Bobby Brown transitioned nicely from her sci-fi roles in Stranger Things and Godzilla: King of the Monsters to a witty, likable character. She's the reason why I didn't feel the need to look at my phone or half-watch it. Her fun character made it worthwhile. The rest of the ensemble does the same as she does. Henry Cavill makes a great Sherlock, Sam Claflin is unrecognizable with both appearance and voice, Helena Bonham Carter plays a fun mother. Everyone matches the each other as their respective characters well.Harry Bradbeer became the main reason for watching once I found out he was in the directors chair. Fleabag is a literal masterpiece and the couple episodes of Killing Eve he directed are great. Knowing his work, this would be an at least fine movie. And it is fine. Similar to Fleabag, there's moments of breaking the fourth wall. That works in most cases but sometimes it didn't add anything. In one case, there hadn't been any fourth wall breaks in a while. They inserted one in and, to me at least, it didn't feel right there. Writer Jack Thorne is a hit or miss. I really liked his writing in Netflix's limited series The Eddy earlier this year, but he also wrote Radioactive, a lackluster biopic. In this case, his writing is good. The comedy hits well and its positive messages. Sometimes it's more focused on its message though. The main theme of the movie is to be yourself. After many scenes of characters getting the point across, it gets redundant.By the middle of the second act, the movie becomes predictable with both its content and pacing. It hits certain beats at certain times where I would've liked more variety with its storytelling. Not that I expected more, but it could've gotten to that 'good' tier of filmmaking. It's good but more on the 'fine' tier. Other than having a good time, there's nothing too special about it. I don't see Enola Holmes as a memorable movie that will be recognized years later. As an afternoon movie or sleepover for younger audiences, this is a great choice. This could've been a dud but with the great cast, good writing, and a good director this exceded expectations.""",7

Director: Harry Bradbeer
Starring: Millie Bobby Brown, Helena Bonham Carter, Sam Claflin, Henry Cavill, Louis partridge, Burn Gorman, Adeel Akhtar, Susan Wokoma, Frances De La Tour etcOverall rating 94/100Enola Holmes, Sherlock Homes little sister, discovers that her mother has gone missing, she must find clue in order to find her again. She must learn to become a lady and make new friends. Enola Holmes was fantastic and I had an absolute blast with it, there is so much good things to talk about so let's get started.First of all the movie had fantastic cinematography, charming tone and fantastic narration from Milly Bobby Brown. The movie had fantastic and unique cinematography and visual styles that worked really well with the tone of the movie, the set pieces were fantastic and reflected the time period as well. Also, the movie had such a charming and fun tone. The Movie had the charm you would expect from a sherlock movie, boosted by the fantastically charming performances and presentation of the movie was a perfect family pleaser. The narration from Millie Bobby Brown was also fantastic, in fact It was one of my favourite parts of the movie, it added to the movies charm, was absolutely hilarious and was helped by the fantastic execution by Millie, it also made the audience interact and engage with the movie a lot more, as well as developing the characters a lot better.My next few positives would be the humour, dialogue, performances and chemistry between characters. The movie was absolutely hilarious, the execution by the actors made it ten times better, but the movie incorporated it's humour into the dialogue so perfectly it worked excellently with loads of laugh out loud moments. The movies dialogue was also exceptionally clever, the dialogue was so excellently crafted and suited the particular cleverness of the sherlock characters, it was very witty and charming and excellently executed. The performances all round were great, everyone did a fantastic job here, but especially Henry Cavill, who played this kind of role perfectly, with heaps of charm and the type of acting he has perfected with the almost deadpan facial expressions and blunt humour. But the real star of the movie obviously has to be Millie Bobby Brown, wow she was just fantastic, and a real star in the making. She was charming and excting to watch, and she fitted the role and executed perfectly, I honestly don't think the character of Enola would have worked so well without her. All the characters had fantastic chemistry as well, making the characters really connect and gel with each other, and making all the relationships and friendships believable and fun to watch.My next few positives would be the set pieces, mystery, interesting relationships and great themes. I thought the set pieces were excellent and fitted the desired time period perfectly, with some beautiful set locations of the manors and the Holmes house. I also loved the mystery element to the movie. As expected with a sherlock linked movie Enola Holmes had to have a compelling and interesting mystery, and it had multiple excellently intertwined with each other and each as fun and interesting to watch unravel. I also thought that the relationships within the film was really interesting, the romantic relationship weren't generic and felt well earned and were actually interesting to watch develop the growing friendship/relationship between Enola and Sherlock was also great leading me to hope for a team up in the future. I also thought the films themes were great and well executed, the feminist themes weren't over the top and were very well executed, proving that women are capable of doing things independently without a man and are just as capable and the whole recurring theme of Enola standing for Alone was very clever as well.My only two slight negatives would be the rushed background and underused characters. I would say that I thought the movie rushed the background into Enola and her mums relationship at the beginning just slightly, I like what they did throughout the movie with their background, but it would have been nice to have a bit more time spent on developing their relationship so the impact of her mums disappearance is executed as well as it should be. I also thought personally that the character of Sherlock was underused, I completely understood why he wasn't used as much due to it being an Enola movie, but Henry Cavill had so much charm and fun with the role that it would have been nice if he was used more which hopefully he will be in the sequel.My final few positives would be the clever plot points, background linked to the main plot, plot twists and satisfying ending. I thought the movie really cleverly told a lot of its plot points with visual clews almost making the movie interactive and forcing you to pay attention to the characters surroundings which was brilliantly done, and should be used more in other films. I also liked the amount of background used for Enola and her mum and how much it linked to the main plot points of the movie. You could really tell how much Enola's mum influenced who she was and the decisions she made throughout the movie and it really made you connect with their relationship and Enola much better. The plot twists were also excellent, many I genuinely didn't see coming, which was fantastic as the movie constantly made me question what was going to happen and often didn't go for something generic or predictable which was refreshing to see. Finally the ending was very satisfying. They solidified the relationships, made good decisions with the characters and I felt satisfied with the amount of plot left open for a sequel.Overall, despite some characters needing to be used more. Enola Holmes is a fantastically crafted, visually pleasing, charming and fun thrill ride that is entertaining from start to finish and further solidifies the star power of all the cast especially Millie Bobby brown.""",9

carlos37andre,"""Great cast, a lot of fun""",28 September 2020,"""Well, the movie is pretty cool. I like it has its own style, and it honestly feel differently from most of the Netflix original movies. Mostly the breaking of the forth wall I guess, gives the movie idk, a different feel from most of the movies out there, cause, well, I don't think is fair to say that breaking the fourth wall is something common, on movies in general.I like most of the rumor in it, it honestly feels a bit Wes Anderson-ish, with the camera style, and the dry humor at times, I liked it. The cast is also great, Millie Bobby Brown just steals the whole thing, and carries it on her shoulders, she's the heart and soul of the movie. But the supporting cast is also good! I wish we had gotten more of Henry Cavill's Sherlock! Cause his relationship with Enola I thought was pretty cute, and had a lot of potential, that's kind of not explored yet. Sam Claflin is good as Mycroft, I just felt a bit weird, that he's more of a jerk this time around, than in other versions of the character we had seemed before, still tho, he was good with the hole. Helena Bonham Carter is great here as well, with the few scenes she had, and well, overall, there wasn't a single actor I thought was bad here.About the plot tho, I like the whole mystery with the mom, and I was really invested in, but I truly thought things start to get a bit convoluted with the whole lord of Tewkesbury or something, for most of it, the two stories don't match at all, they keep jumping from one storyline to the other, and they sort of tie it up at the end, but, after just one viewing of the movie, I felt like the didn't quit wrapped up the mom's storyline. What were the bombs for after all? They sort of introduce that she is a revolutionary or something, she's apparently planning to bomb some place to... put pressure on the vote thing to pass, I guess? But at the end, is the dude's vote that makes it happen, and they don't really say anything else about what she's doing, and why exactly she did run away.And well, with that, I think the movie goes a bit longer than it should have, it loses some of its energy through the last 30ish minutes, and I truly think it would be a lot better if they had almost completely removed the whole lord storyline. Still, I had fun watching it, and if this is indeed a new franchise, I'm on board with another one.7,5/10""",7

The story is all over the place, and the pacing is so off you could have just showed any of it in any order and it wouldn't have made much difference. The acting was great though!
If you enjoy Sherlock, you might not really like this all that much, however there is a possibility that you will and in that case i think you should give it a watch.
Is Enola Holmes a good movie? Sure. Is it a great movie? Definitely not, however it was VERY entertaining, and overall just good fun.

And i hate the breaking of 4th wall, just doesn't fit here at all in my opinion.""",5
Indian_Analyst,"""A teenager's movie; yet intriguing.""",27 September 2020,"""Even though the movie was made by keeping the modern day teenager girls in mind(or as it seems), the craftiness in movie making as well as the acting prowess of each and every actor, make it quite worthy for watching; at least for once. The performance of Millie Bobby Brown, makes her as a possible successor for Natalie Portman.

Netflix hit a home run with this movie. A good combination of witty comedy, solving mysteries clues, and occasional action scenes. As for Millie, she was breathtaking in her role. I loved her in Stranger Things but found her performance a bit underwhelming in Godzilla (although it was in a secondary role). She looked totally into making this movie work, and it worked so well. It had you constantly on the edge of you seat, not knowing what shenanigans would come next.

A gregarious young woman does the saving and sleuthing, fights for suffrage, outwits her much older brothers, and in the end saved Democracy. And isn't that the kind of movie we could ALL use right now?I'm a terrible judge, but I can't figure out for the life of me why it's rated PG13. Some jujitsu battles and old-timey fisticuffs, as well as a fun scene with fireworks/explosives, and the baddie does die in the end, but it's more or less an accident. No language, nudity, sex, and even Sherlock is stone cold sober. I'd rate it PG for age 9-10+ and a must watch family film!

I do wish she didn't do the fourth wall breaks, it really feels like she's either turning to a documentary crew or suddenly updating instagram. It was a little jarring, and they're clearly referencing Sherlock's ""mind palace"" techniques displayed in the movies, but with a ""twist"".I honestly expected someone to ask her if she's okay, like in ""Dora and the Lost City of Gold"". It would have been equally acceptable to do narration over her actions in the same, but I understand wanting to do something different.The only other people that didn't seem to be phoning it in were Burn Gorman who did quite a good antagonist, and Frances de la Tour who managed to elevate ""concerned grannie"".Maybe Sam Claflin did the job perfectly and Mycroft is supposed to be that bland and irritating, but Henry Cavill had an air of being relieved that didn't have to have Sherlock doing any real deductions, he just had to stand there and seem mildly intrigued by things.Overall, there is a good movie here in spite of itself, and the sad part is that it could have been great.""",7

tpatoliya,"""Comfortable movie with so many good things to watch""",26 September 2020,"""Netflix film ""Enola Holmes"" is about a young woman in search of self, but the film takes a deeper investigation into the power, family bonds and risks of changing a world.The film is a murder mystery, so every scene of it is full of thrills. In every aspect of the story, you are forced to think about what is going to happen in the coming scene.The film offers a tricky insight into her curious mind without losing her charm, whether it is her unwavering faith in her mother, her undying love for Sherlock, the ability to see life as an endless series of puzzles and not her identity in the process To loseThe teenage romance between the young prince and the title hero is perhaps the film's most heart-touching dimension; It is delicate, soft and important.The film balances various genre-specific elements with enough flourish, be it thrill, action, romance, suspense or thrill.Screenwriter Jack Thorne doesn't mess too much with the editing patterns of modern Sherlock Holmes. He cleverly bridges the flashback sequences, so that you can also simplify the events around you.Millie Bobby Brown is an excellent choice to play the title character and never let the sadness of this part diminish his mental strength.Apart from 'Stranger Things', it is fantastic to see her in a good character. Her presence makes the film more exciting.Sam Claflin's Mycroft is a lot more poignant than seen on the BBC's version. Unfortunately, Henry's opportunity to focus on Sherlock assumes that his character must be found in the narrative.Sherlock went unnoticed as Henry's costumes, body language to mold himself.Luis Partridge is beloved as the handsome, young prince who shares on-screen chemistry with Brown with a terrifying spirit.Helena Bonham Carter as Eudora Holmes has a limited presence, but the way she uses her presence minimally and so effectively.I believe Harry Bradbeer had a solid reason to keep this film for only 120 minutes. It is a conscious decision to bring non-Sherlock fans to their territory.Although the film still seems a little slow, but Harry Bradbeer has handled it well.Enola Holmes is an emotional mother-daughter story, but it is full of action, comedy, drama and lots of thrills.""",8

Rathbone, the best of them in Holmes series, didn't suffer fools.

The production often feels cheap, dialogue feels forced at times, and there is something to be said about the race of certain characters, though only when it comes to their status, given that the film is set in the 1890's.As said, Millie I think does great as Enola. She's charming, witty, and has a certain physicality in the role that was refreshing. Henry Cavill broods as a gentler Sherlock Holmes than previous iterations, but his size makes it hard to see anything but superman playing dress-up, and I say this as a fan. Sam Claflin is good as the eccentric Mycroft, though he has less of a presence in the film than one might think.The story starts off interesting, with the disappearance of Helena Bonham Carter's Mrs. Holmes, only leaving hidden messages for Enola, who promptly goes after her, with Sherlock reluctantly doing the same. This could have been an interesting story on its own, but a good chunk of the film spends time with a certain boy on a train, which was uninteresting and really slowed the film down.The focus should have been on Enola and her place in this quite legendary family an the world as a woman.

She's about breaking the norms. It's history; you can't argue with history.Now, the movie is fun. I love the idea of Sherlock Holmes having a little sister, and I love the Nancy Drew vibe. Millie Bobby Brown is a wonderful actress, and really brings this character to life. Netflix has finally made a film that parents will enjoy watching with their preteens.There are some far fetched moments while she is running through all of England looking for her mother and saving a boy's life.

The way Enola was portrayed was fine, but if she was just slightly sassier and tough (more veronica mars Esque) I feel like it would've elevated the film a lot more. Enola Holmes is a great role model, but I feel as if she doesn't quite meet that bar where girls would want to be her. There are so many cool lines that would have been even spicier is she was played differently. Millie Bobby Brown doesn't sell the role for me, I genuinely feel like I was watching her say lines. The breaking of the fourth wall was a cool idea, but I feel like it was very much overdone in the film, if it was slightly more subtle and less often I feel like it would've had that immersive effect that was trying to be achieved. For me, the breaking of the fourth wall so excessive to the point where it took me out of the film. Although having a very well known cast is what pulled the initial audience in, I feel as though at least casting Enola as someone unknown would've sold the period piece. Obviously, my opinion doesn't matter in the slightest, but I was disappointed. I was really excited for this movie, but I didn't feel convinced the whole time. There was just something missing. A spark perhaps. Considering that, a lot of people have different opinions than mine, which means it must have an appeal that I'm missing.""",2

A playful rendition of a young and incorrigible woman's inner journey, intertwined with the indomitable spirit of the Suffragette movement, Enola Holmes is a refreshing addition to the family of detective royalty. Aesthetically pleasing and well-shot, the viewer is convincingly whisked away into the prim and proper Victorian era. The always vivacious Millie Bobby Brown is well-cast and delightful in her role.

The 4th wall gets broken on multiple occasions which feels highly out of place within the context of the narrative. The idea that this is the sister of the already famous character Sherlock Holmes is neither here nor there. The actual Sherlock Holmes is portrayed as a heartless nobody. Somebody could have perhaps created a new storybook character rather than high jack an existing one - badly. This writers of this film appear too hung up on other issues rather than just telling a good story. You will be disappointed in this film if you enjoy decent, meaningful and moving cinema.

Writers: Nancy Springer (novel), Jack Thorne (screenplay)
Stars: Millie Bobby Brown, Henry Cavill, Sam ClaflinThe film has serious production value. The period piece customs are wonderful. The set design and the outstanding cinematography transport the viewer back in time to England, 1884 - a world on the brink of change. The world of this film is a pleasure to disappear into.There's a choice make by the production to have Enola break the fourth wall repeatedly throughout ""Enola Holmes."" She's not always sharing plot information, she also with a wink -and a -nod inject humor almost treating the viewer like a trusted confidant. It works brilliantly as Millie Bobby Brown is able build an emotion connection and becomes a very likable character for our emotional investment.Millie Bobby Brown brings the teenage sleuth to life , with an energetic and effervescent performance as the smart, cunning and ingenious Enola Holmes . The film is well-made, well-paced and beautifully crafted family feature that has something for everyone to enjoy. And hopefully the first of a series of films.""",8
Prismark10,"""Enola Holmes""",24 September 2020,"""Based on a series of Young Adult novels that introduced a younger sister of Sherlock Holmes.Enola Holmes has a remarkably mature performance from Millie Bobby Brown in the title role.Enola is a 16 year old independent minded teenager raised by her mother (Helena Bonham Carter) to be free spirited. Enola has had little contact with her two older brothers since they left home after the death of their father.When Mrs Holmes suddenly disappears, Her two older brothers reappear in her life. Mycroft Holmes (Sam Claflin) is her guardian and wants her to send her to a cruel finishing school. Sherlock Holmes (Henry Cavill) just sits silently gazing.It seems to be a mystery why the two brothers are not that worried that their mother has gone off somewhere.It is vibrant Enola who goes off to find her mother. She meets her mother's network of ladies in London. She also finds adventure with a runaway Lord Tewkesbury whose life is in danger.Enola Holmes is sloppy and overlong. It should had been a tighter and a more spirited adventure. The biggest problem is the characterisation of Mycroft Holmes. There have been interesting interpretations of him in the past by actors such as Christopher Lee, Charles Gray, Mark Gatiss. The Mycroft played by Claflin is a horrendous caricature. An uncaring chauvinist monster when he is supposed to be Sherlock's more smarter brother.As for Sherlock Holmes himself. Of course he is meant to have a smaller supporting role in this. Expectations need to be lowered as he is played by a plank of wood. I did expect Sherlock to be more concerned about the fate of his mother and sister and open minded to the feminist bent of this story. The character is just too passive.The film looks expensive, it is slick but also lacklustre. However I would like to see more Enola Holmes as played by Millie Bobby Brown.""",5

It was also good to see Enola taking centre stage and consistently outwitting the quite famous male lead in Sherlock Holmes. Millie Brown is believable and fun as Enola and the rest of the cast are good as well.The movie fails to deliver with the plotline though. It's quite uninteresting and a bit preachy. It's nice to see Enola's development through the movie, but it could have done with a better plot. The ending was very lacklustre as well. Good attempt nonetheless.

It was just enough #metoo in my opinion. Why can't we allow children today watch a movie based in a period hundreds of years ago that paints a world more inclusive of woman. I happen to enjoy almost any movie with a strong female lead as long as it is done well and this movie has so much to enjoy!Millie Bobbi Brown gives me young Natalie Portman vibes, she has charisma and never breaks character, I didn't see one weak scene where she didn't hold my attention. The script was smart, comical and sassy and avoided the pitfalls of movies like Deadpool 2 which annoyingly felt like an extended Jimmy Carr standup show. (1.5hrs of one liner after one liner) Like Deadpool 2, this movie breaks the fourth wall throughout and it never got annoying.Props to the young marques who I have never seen in anything else but easily held his own and reminded me of Brenton Thwaites.

This is more a coming-of-age film about a young woman that rebels against the male-dominant culture and does things *her way*. While her focus was primarily on finding her mother, Out in the real world, she finds things not as simple as her previous cocooned life. She doesn't subscribe to the damsel-in-distress needing help from men, and on the contrary, is in the dominant role of protector on several occasions. Her older brother, Mycroft, is a typical male in the sense of *men dominant, women subservient* role. He is the most one-note character of the film. Younger brother, Sherlock, is more nuanced and balanced, often seen as a role model for the burgeoning investigative talents of his younger sister. This is an excellent role for Millie Bobby Brown, expanding her talents to become a lead in a movie. I loved her breaking the fourth wall and being the primary was an amazing supporting cast. I love her transitioning from child actor to adult/young adult actor, with her character in this movie doing the same.""",8

This of course leads to lots of rushed scenes and unanswered questions.Some questions I had were:How did the man in the bowler hat find Enola? How did he know Enola and Tewkesbury were going to confront Tewkesbury's uncle? Why was Tewkesbury's vote on the Reform Bill so important? What happened with the mother's feminist group? How did Sherlock solve the case? (they show you, but it wasn't very convincing.)If you dissect the movie (like I did) it loses it's luster, but that's no excuse for lazy writing and a weak plot.

grarunkumar1994,"""Disgrace to ""Holmes""""",26 September 2020,"""There had been umpteen attempts to recreate Arthur Conan Doyle's Detective, a creation more eminent than the creator; most of which leaves without a trail, with a few staying in memory- Robert Downey Jr and Benedict Cumberbatch being the recent ones.
Enola Holmes is an attempt to squeeze out money from the satisfaction of viewers to revisit mystery solving in Victorian England by a genius detective, the one Arthur had addicted us with.
Here, the makers are adamant to do it but lazy to write a script suitable for the character. Next best option? Write up a sibling who is as intelligent as him, but a bit immature. And there she is. His younger sister.
Story is even more pathetic. The lady Holmes disappears 'without a trace'..but leaves a ton of clues for Enola to find. Enola leaves home in search of her mother. She gets involved with a boy, a teenage well read , charismatic guy from a respected family, weak enough for Enola to save him multiple times and dumb enough to not understand he is a target for murder. Romance blooms in between this ""finding mom"" and ""staying alive"" mysteries.
Apparently mother had taught Enola everything from encyclopedia to JuJitsu to tackle problems in life. Quite convenient.
If the makers had intention to do this way, sticking on to ""Holmes"" name should be understood as cheap marketing technique to attract audience.
Wouldn't have complained so much if the screenplay was decent at the least. This is a pathetic attempt to make a movie.
Did Mother leave for secret meetings- Yes.
Did she carry on with the plan- No.
Did the emotions work out in movie - No.
Was the romance good- Cliched
Was the plot stromg regarding female suppression in 19th century - No. A few lines is not enough.
Are the fights good( after all these claim that ""mother taught me"")- Pathetic.
The assassin- slowpoke, more distractable than a scared rabbit, gets easily beat up by 16yr old girl.( Most definitely it wasnt jujitsu or any other martial art that gave her the upper hand)
The teen boy - ripped right out of a high school romantic drama.
Only good things.
Cinematography.
Production value - the real & virtual sets.
Henry Cavil as Sherlock. a brief but not so impressive presence, yet he looks suitable.
If the makers had ambitious hope to make such a movie, the least they could do is to get a gripping screenplay.
Nancy Springer would have threatened Hollywood to make a movie from such a novel.""",1
bankofmarquis,"""A winning (enough) combination""",18 October 2020,"""I'm a sucker for Sherlock Holmes. I grew up watching the fantastic black and white Holmes films from the 1940's starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. I checked out '70's Holmes flicks like MURDER BY DECREE and the 7 PERCENT SOLUTION and then re-fell-in-love with Holmes with the Jeremy Brett BBC SHERLOCK HOLMES TV series of the 1980's and, of course, Benedict Cumberbatch's modern take on the master sleuth in the 2000's was ""must see TV"" for me. I was even on-board with Robert Downey Jr's. ""take"" on this iconic sleuth and was thrilled when Sir Ian McKellen portrayed an elderly Sherlock Holmes in MR. HOLMES.So...I eagerly awaited the Netflix treatment of the ""younger"" sister of Sherlock Holmes in ENOLA HOLMES -and, I gotta say, I wasn't disappointed.Based on the Young Adult series of novels by Nancy Springer, ENOLA HOLMES introduces us to the (heretofore unknown) younger sister of Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes. Raised by a fiercely independent mother in the late 1880's, Enola goes searching for her when she goes missing and gets mixed up in the ""The Case of the Missing Marquess"" along the way.Millie Bobbie Brown (STRANGER THINGS) is a winning, charismatic (enough) performer as Enola. She is a steady and sure hand at the helm of this ship throughout the course of this 2 hour and 3 minute adventure. While I would have liked her to command the screen more with her presence, she does enough to make it a good, solid, effort.The supporting cast is just as good. Helena Bonham Carter (FIGHT CLUB) is perfectly cast as Enola's (and Sherlock's and Mycroft's) mother - she has that fierce streak of independence and ""don't mess with me"" energy while carving her own path. She is the type of character that one would go looking for if she went missing. Sam Claflin (HUNGER GAMES: CATCHING FIRE) is finely unrecognizable (at least to me) as Mycroft - written in this piece as the more ""traditional"" of the Holmes family and Henry Cavill (MAN OF STEEL) brings a strong arrogance to his portrayal of Sherlock. He also brings something else - heart - to this character, a character trait that has ""traditional"" fans of this character up in arms. For me, it works well in the context of this film.As for the film itself - it is good (enough). I found myself enjoying the mystery and the characters and enjoyed my time in this world. It's not anything new, but it's like putting on a pair of old shoes - comforting to wear.This is an adaptation of the first book of the series, and I, for one, hope that there are more. It's a winning combination that was pleasant to watch.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)""",7

Its central mysteries aren't all that complex or involving and its 'find yourself' theming has definitely been done before, but the piece moves at a fairly quick pace and is bolstered by solid performances from its entire cast. Surprisingly, it's constant to-camera narration actually works rather well, cementing the thing's distinct style and storybook feel. It's sometimes a bit too violent for its own good, raising its 'bar for entry' a little too high than it ought to, and it's also tonally inconsistent overall.

They could have made her the centre of attention while ensuring that people around her have an IQ of atleast 1, but why would the writers do that when they can just insert ""haha men bad"" into every scene.I do not care about the historical accuracy of the film. I do not care about the plot holes. I do not care about the lead being a woman, but for gods sake, stop alienating a big part of the audience just to peddle an agenda, hollywood.

When used correctly it can be very effective and funny *cough* Fleabag *cough*. However, this movie felt like an episode of Dora the explorer) set in the 19th century, this failed attempt was nothing compared to Millie Bobby Brown's failed attempt to be a mature actress. As well as her performance being cringe worthy, it is almost as though she refused to try and make the movie feel like it was set in the 19th century. Although she is not meant to be a sophisticated ""lady"" she acts as though she is acting in a movie set in modern times. Her performance struggled to get in touch with the character's feelings due to her stiff performance and inability to develop an accent which would coincide with enola's mother's accent. It was like she was saying her lines and not acting them.Some of the camera shots and framing decisions, didn't help the movie already feeling like it wasn't set in the 19th century, at times, either. The movie also shames women who did want the ""transitional"" lifestyle and makes it feel as though the women were foolish for wanting to dress like that. This alongside the movie trying to mirror current events, to do with injustice, in a movie which is meant to be a time period movie, makes everything feel forced. Yes, there are many discussions that needed to be had but they didn't portray the real problems of that time, while also spreading myths of corsets.The relationship between Enola and her love interest also felt extremely forced, as did the way she discovered her mother's clues. While you can see what the movie was trying to achieve, with its caricature-istic feel, the movie flops in this aspect. It feels over done, out of place at times and the ending (where they tried to have that typical encouraging ending, where the main character has the last word) was just unnecessary and didn't feel professional while it was repetative of her introduction.+ However, the performance form most of the other actors were convincing (Helena Bonham Carter, the roles of sherlock and Mycroft).

ninja-111,"""Underwelming and stumbling.""",23 September 2020,"""The most surprising part about this flick, is that it appears to have been directed by a rookie; poorly and with a glance at Guy Ritchie, and filmed by a moderately talented high schooler who learned cinematography from YouTube. The lighting is dreadful and so flat at times it risks falling of the screen from a stiff breeze.Acting, writing, and so on was adequate, but the plot couldve been so, so much darker if they just dared to go there - theres a hitman out to murder children for Pete's sake. Doesnt get much darker than that. And it is the times of the Women Reform - remember, this is London in the early 1900s. Women were basically second class citizens, barely more worth than the orphans and tarts of Whitechapel if not in the company of a man.
Keep heaping on the darkness, and we'd have something worthy of watching.On a personal note: Sherlock and Mycroft are the characters in name only. They share close to nothing with the originals.
Example; Sherlock cares about others, and Mycroft is thin and short tempered.In short: it stumbles between mildy interesting characters, moderately intriguing plot and a coming of age story, only to end with a wimpering yawn.
Hopefully this will become a series akin to the BBC Sherlock, and this travesty is only a show finding its footing.""",6

If I wanted a character talking to the camera (which really WAS pointless for this movie), I would have watched ""The Office"" (at least in that case it's meant to felt like a documentary).

I give them credit for not, at least, stopping the movie completely to ask the food services people what THEY thought, or a cutaway shot of the production crew behind cameras watching the production.

Just the movie itself.You don't have to be a Holmes to figure out the whole plot of the movie. It's filled with clichés, you can see everything that's coming, from the jokes (it tries to be a funny movie but fails) to the villain.The way it's filmed it tries to emulate the other Holmes films, but for teenage audience. It's well done except for the fourth wall breaking. It's not used in the correct way, is annoying and the constant looking of Enola directly to the camera without saying anything gives the movie an essence of a lame actress (which is not the case with Millie Bobby Brown) that forgets that she is filming and looks where she shouldn't. The same goes with all the feminist messages in the movie. Most of them are forced. You don't have to say all the time that the female character is clever and strong, as good as her brother Sherlock, just show it, make the audience believe that with her actions, not with words coming all the time from other characters mouths. That's how you deliver a powerful messages especially to the young audience, well executed actions mean more than repetitive phrases.Most of the characters are well done (some are clichés but work). Millie Bobby Brown performance is solid (despite the fourth wall issue), Helena Bonham Carter is great, just another walk in the park for her tho, it's not a complicated character (which I wish appeared more in the movie) and Henry Cavill is ok, not the usual Sherlock but at times the classic character comes out and shines.Nevertheless is an enjoyable movie, a new perspective that needs to be polished. Not the detective movie to rack your brains out, but the one to turn them off and relax.""",5

They present Enola as a strong, independent young girl, but have her immediately swooning over some boring boy and making all of her decisions based on this boy she just met. Tonal mismatch is the game that's afoot here as the film tries to be a mystery, teen romance, feminist revolution, and adventure story and none of it meshes very well. The ""mystery,"" if you can call it that, is dull and predictable. I also don't know what they did to Mycroft as his character is some over-the-top, evil caricature.There is some good here though. Millie Bobby Brown shines as the lead, though the constant fourth wall breaks are a bit jarring. The decision to cast Henry Cavill as Sherlock was brilliant and I would love to see him spinoff and continue the role in some manner. The scenes with Sherlock and Enola are by far the highlight of the film. The music and production design are both solid as well. The movie started off as very engaging, but soon drags for its excessive runtime.I wanted to like this film more than I did, but there was just a lot that didn't work for me.

Millie Bobby Brown is the star of the show, her role is the best part from this film, with her unique charisma and a dynamic that many hollywood actresses should study and replicate.

Enola breaks the fourth wall often and while that annoyed a lot of reviewers, it's when most of the comedy came through. I thought it was a cute addition and showed Enola's personality more.
All in all, if you're looking for a fun, exciting family movie - this is definitely it!""",9

I didn't like the out of focus plot with its misdirection and holes. The joyful music and Enola's dialogue with the viewer, only emphasises the pretentiousness of the direction, even if the novel on which is based was like that - which I don't care consulting.
Henry Cavill is the only star in this ranking. Just give him James Bond's role immediately, to use his time and charisma more meaningfully than appearing as second guest in such messes.Overall conclusion: If you are not 10 years old girl, avoid.

Some clever word play, lovely victorian-esque set pieces and a great cast keep this movie going along rather well.The people putting this film down need to check themselves; it's based on a novel and is fictional. It's only similar to the past. People need to stop glorifying the 1800's as some sort of golden age, calling for realism. Why would you want to watch a film where you're segregated because of race and women are barely treated as humans and are essentially ignored in legislation.

We know it's only a movie, so we don't need a pretentious director to remind us by trying to involve us. We don't need Stranger Things to look into the camera and tell us she's getting on a train when we actually SEE her doing so.
The whole plot is convoluted too. It centers around a runaway mother who did not want to be found, yet she left clues so that all 3 of her children could find her. Something to do with voting rights and blowing up Parliament, we think. Never really explained.

sharnelperera,"""Snooze fest""",26 September 2020,"""I was so excited to watch this, being a big fan of the older Sherlock Holmes films, but this was honestly nothing more than a snooze fest. The cast was impressive however the storyline was incredibly boring. You'd think a film revolving around the mystery disappearance of Sherlock Holmes (and therefore Enola Holmes's) mother would be somewhat exciting.... but it isn't. Probably the most infuriating thing about the film is Enola herself where she insists on speaking directly to us, the audience. Yes, we get it, you're a young and curious girl about to go on an 'adventure'. Just shut up and get on with it will you?! Sadly, the 'adventure' just never eventuates until maybe the last 10 minutes or so where there is a brief and extremely boring moment where Enola and her love interest are being shot at. But neither is seriously injured ofcourse. Throughout the film, the so called 'puzzle' regarding Enola's mother's disappearance unravels excruciating slowly and with seemingly very little effort or any real detective work. About a quarter of the way into this film, I was looking at the clock wondering when it will end and debating whether or not I should just switch it off early. I persevered on the silly notion that perhaps it will get better. Unfortunately, it didn't.""",3

Like many other detective movies, it set up a hunting-treasure puzzle but everything went too fast. It didn't show much of the characters or the story plot, it's more like a summary.When what happened to Enola's mother, it only took around 25mintues after that for Enola to solve the puzzle that her mom left behind and went on her adventure, and how she's able to figure out everything so fast. In my opinion, the movie rushed through the storyline of her mother while trying to cover Enola character with a short amount of time so it felt like something is missing. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate female protagonist, this one just felt undercooked. I would say it'd be better if the movie length was around 3-4 hours or make it into a series.The views in the movie were really fascinating but I wish they didn't put too much color contrast.

The plot is weird, that she goes on an adventure with a noble kid and somewhat developed feeling for him?, but wasn't her goal was to find her mother in the beginning? In the end she didn't find her mother, more like her mother show up out of nowhere and give us audience another heavy blows of feminism... her mothers role is to a symbol about woman rights, but woman do have rights right now (I'm not getting into the detail that some part of woman's right can be better), so what's the point of this movie? if you want to have a movie intend to audience for children (which I totally think it is), may I suggest you throw out the political correctness?I personally don't see why Henry Cavill is casted for this supporting role, but I guess they need an A name on the list to attract audience, but overall having a strong actor like Cavill on a supporting role feel like it shifts away focus from the main protagonist. I'll not get into detail of how this writer has zero respect for Sir Conan Doyle's work, the rewrite of Mycroft and Sherlocks personality is horrible.overall, I think the cast did their job well, but i do not recommend this movie as I'm unsure of what I'm watching, and I feel like this is an unnecessary movie for political correctness.""",4

Both the Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011) movie and Sherlock Holmes (2009) movie, is very good, with an 8/10 score each.SO WHY ON EARTH if the recent movies/series was such highly acclaimed productions, would they deviate so massively from the formula AND do an entire recasting of all the actors while they're at it? It's no wonder then that this movie ended up being only a 5/10 affair. It contains no comedy and honestly very little intrigue, which is something that the above-mentioned titles all had very much of. And with a budget of $60 million, it's truly difficult to see where all that money went to... I mean, the first RDJ Sherlock Holmes movie had a budget of $90 and that movie was filled with massive set-pieces and impressive action sequences, yet this Enola Holmes movie is quite honestly lacking of anything like that.So it has no comedy, little intrigue, no action to speak of and doesn't even have a finished ending... the movie literally ends after 120minutes with NO explanation or resolution of the BIGGEST plot detail in the entire movie (which is of course Enola's mother). Why would you spend 2hours exploring the actions of Enola's mother, and then at the end give literally no explanation of it... it's the dumbest and most disappointing ending to a movie that I've seen in ages.If you're looking for a great movie/series in the Sherlock Holmes universe, then rather watch the titles I've mentioned above, and stay far away from this movie... it's not worth your time and will just lead you along for 2hours only to ultimately disappoint you in the end.""",5

I was surprised at how much I loved Sam Claflin in this role as Mycroft; I never would have thought to cast him as such a character, but he pulls it off perfectly. All the leads are charming and entertaining . . . and they add a nice bit of scenery, of course. I couldn't quite get over the casting of a younger actor for the older brother, though; to me it was obvious that Henry Cavill is older than Claflin, and it kept throwing me off. Each performed wonderfully in their roles, though, so I can't completely fault the casting choices. I wasn't a huge fan of how feeling they had Sherlock's character here, it didn't feel true to the Sherlock of his books, but I'm willing to overlook that as being nitpicky on my part.

It's also targetting a demographic of a family watching or everyone who is to be entertained.And this movie does it perfectly. There was no point in the movie that I'd feel bored and it's the little touches where there doesn't need to be a dialogue just a facial expression that you have to be carefully watching in order to understand the whole message of the movie and its focus.4th wall breaking across the whole duration adds a little touch and you do really feel into the main character if you are watching thoroughly. It's in no way a serious Sherlock movie and for a really tough Sherlock fan you better go watch 2009 Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock as in my opinion he does a far better ""Sherlock"" Job.Anyhow even though Sherlock is absolutely different for how he should be portrayed it just fits in this a little twisted Sherlock world. And to do justice with the script that I believe has only one point to entertain the audience Henry Cavil does as ever a great job as does the whole cast!To summ it up:At first I thought going into this, that it will be just a ""low budget"" Sherlock movie with some twisted character portrayal and I would just dislike it as a whole,..It... it just wasn't the case at all!I genuinely enjoyed it for the whole duration with a mindset that this may be some side universe of Sherlock and with that in mind ( Sherlock hard fan turned off) I very much liked it and will recommend it to anyone who really isn't a die hard Sherlock fan.And for those kind of people this movie is 10/10Cheers and have a great time.""",10

kingofdanerds,"""Great acting but not so great of a mystery""",14 October 2020,"""Well, when I had nothing else to do, I decided to take to Netflix to keep me busy and Enola Holmes was in the top movies. So, why not? Enola Holmes is a 2020 Netflix original (but was originally slated for a theatrical release but due to COVID 19 was put on Netflix). The film stars Millie Bobby Brown who is a fairly popular young actress who has starred in Stranger Things. She also produced this film which is even more extraordinary. Also Henry Cavill (as Sherlock Holmes) and Helena Bonham Carter. The film is based off of some books of which I have not read. The film got positive reviews from critics and audiences of which praised the performance Millie Bobby Brown.The film follows Enola Holmes who lives with her mother. Enola is the younger sister of Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes. One day, Enola's mother goes missing and Sherlock and Mycroft return home. Enola then goes into the care of Mycroft who is dissappointed with Enola and wants to enroll her in a school for girls. Enola runs away, not wanting to do what Mycroft wants, and meets Lord Tewksbury who is a young lord. The rest of the film follows Enola solving the mysteries surrounding her mother and this Lord Tewksbury.Well, for one, the critics were right about one thing. The acting from Millie Bobby Brown is really phenomenal. She is very talented in everything that I have seen her in (and to be honest Stranger Things is the only thing so far that I have seen her in). The acting all around is really good. Another thing I really like is the message here in this film. That being about oppression and feminism and also finding out who you are. I think that those themes were relevant back then and are most certainly relevant today. Those two things, the acting and the themes, are really the two strong points of this film and they really hold this film. But there are some negative things I have to say about this film. The first is more of a minor complaint when compared to the other criticism that I have. The first minor criticism is the fourth wall breaking. It happens way to often and gets really annoying. Fourth wall breaking can be done a clever ways. Take a look at Deadpool for instance. It was alright the first couple of times but after a while it got annoying. Most of the time Enola talks to the audience when she breaks this fourth wall. But there are times when she just glances. I just did not find it very clever and the film could have easily done without. Another minor complaint is that I somewhat wish Sherlock Holmes had a bigger part in the story. The big reason that I watched this film was for the fact that Sherlock Holmes was in this film. Granted, having more focus on Sherlock would definitely take away from Enola who is the star of the film. Also, this is Enola's mystery to solve and not Sherlock's. Which leads me to a major complaint that I seem to find common in some reviews. The mystery. First off all, there are two mysteries. One involving the disappearance of Enola's mother and the other being who is trying to kill Lord Tewksbury. Both mysteries are not very engaging. I have to keep talking about Sherlock Holmes but, Sherlock Holmes mysteries are supposed to be mysteries that work your mind and make you think really hard. These mysteries, do not. But, technically this is not a Sherlock Holmes mystery, this is an Enola Holmes mystery. The conclusions to these mysteries are very predictable and even the way Enola figures them out is by doing cryptograms or something. It is somewhat of a downer. The way I see it, Enola Holmes should be basically Sherlock Holmes but female. I guess a good example would be James Bond Jr. who is basically James Bond, but little. Hopefully that makes sense in what I am trying to describe here....Enola Holmes has some truly fantastic acting and great themes that are fairly relevant but I found myself dissapointed by the lack of mystery surrounding these mysteries. Though I do believe some people would actually get more out of this film that I myself did.""",6

Tweekums,"""A fun Nineteenth Century investigation with Sherlock Holmes' younger sister""",27 September 2020,"""This film is centred on Enola Holmes, the sixteen year old sister of famous detective Sherlock.

When her mother mysteriously disappears she is made the ward of elder brother Mycroft, he intends to send her to boarding school so she runs away; determined to follow clues left by her mother. On the train she crosses paths with the young Viscount Tewkesbury who has also fled his family and is being searched for by a man in a brown bowler hat. She helps him escape and once in London they part ways... it isn't too long before she realises that she must help him if she is to solve her own problems. While she is undertaking her investigation brother Sherlock is looking for her.I really enjoyed this film despite not being in the target demographic. It was fun from start to finish; largely thanks to Millie Bobby Brown's brilliant performance as our eponymous heroine... I'd be very surprised if she doesn't become a major name in Hollywood. The character is spirited and likeable, delivering occasional fourth wall breaking comments to camera. The rest of the cast, which includes several familiar faces also impresses. The story provides some nice twists and turns and some genuinely tense moments, but nothing too scary for all but younger children. There is also plenty of humour but nothing too forced. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to anybody after fun, inoffensive, family suitable adventure.""",8

But I was pleasantly surprised. Yeah the feminist themes were a on the nose at times, but not shallow as I expected.
As for historical accuracy. The character Enola's representation is the most inaccurate: lose hair, low necklines during day time, no hat etc. But the character in the background of shots were immaculately dressed. As if the costume designers put more work into them than the main characters.
Furthermore, a lot of people have criticized it for being too ""pc"" for its inclusiveness.

Racism isn't the only thing that would make something historically accurate.""",7
PyroSikTh,"""Sherlock for Teenage Girls""",25 September 2020,"""When we first watched the trailer for this, I put it firmly in the 'not interested' list. It just ultimately looked like the kind of movie that just wasn't for me, and honestly that's exactly what it was. However my wife and I agreed that Henry Cavill as Sherlock Holmes was too hard to resist (and I say that as a perfectly straight male).But of course Enola Holmes isn't about Henry Cavill as Sherlock, it's about his little sister Enola, who has absolutely no basis in the stories of Arthur Conan Doyle, but I guess teenage girls need a proxy in order to enjoy these kinds of stories? And that's pretty much exactly how this movie plays out; Sherlock Holmes for teenage girls. The similarities between Enola and Sherlock are remarkable, down to the super smarts and personality quirks. Of course no story about a teenage girl would be complete without a super rich and boyishly handsome teenage love interest. Enter the young Lord Tewkesbury who has run away from his responsibilities fearing for his life after the untimely death of his father, and a nationwide manhunt commences, one that Sherlock is particularly uninterested in. Lucky for the young Lord that he bumps into Enola then, I guess.There's also the story of Enola's missing mother who vanished in the dead of night presumably to commit some terrorist acts in the name of the suffragettes, a detail which is perhaps wisely not pursued too far. And yet the lingering hints and unfinished business with it all in the end doesn't exactly leave a pleasant taste in the mouth. In truth this little detail is a little murky as it is, attempting to tie the whole story together under the banner of female empowerment, and yet Enola's life is still fundamentally driven by the men around her, either running from Mycroft's control, confiding in Sherlock, or becoming inextricably lured towards Tewkesbury and his problems. It almost certainly passes the Bechdel test, but when every woman in the movie other than Enola is portrayed as a proto-antagonist (including her own mother), it's maybe not quite reaching the point it so desperately wants to.Then there's the plot holes and conveniences that are sprinkled about, from magically omnipresent and all-knowing bad guys, to a final twist that makes little sense and is barely reasoned out in the movie itself, just in the name of pure shock value. I could also criticise historical inaccuracies as well, but I'm at least open-minded enough to acknowledge some liberties need to be taken for a compelling story.I'm not a particularly huge fan of Millie Bobby Brown, but I have to admit she does a remarkable job here, managing so much with so little. Her joy and her sadness are infectious, she carries the entire movie on her shoulders without any signs of struggle, and her fourth wall breaks are delightfully charming in every instance. Sam Claflin is perfectly antagonising as Mycroft, determined to make a lady of Enola and unwilling to realise her true potential, while Henry Cavill plays Sherlock with a softer and more empathetic side than the character is typically known for. Maybe it's just Cavill's natural charm that he is incapable of turning off. Yes, I would totally watch a Sherlock story with Cavill in the lead role. I need more. Helena Bonham Carter honestly doesn't get enough time, or a deep enough character to play with, but she's quite clearly set up ready to make a big impact in the sequel, whatever form that takes. Frances de la Tour and Fiona Shaw (more Harry Potter alumna) are also as dastardly and interesting as they need to be for the story.Enola Holmes is not a good movie, not by any means. It's another movie far too afraid of taking big risks, and so its message of female empowerment (written and directed by guys, no less) falls flat and shallow at best, and contradictory at worst. There are a lot of fun moments, and Millie Bobby Brown tears up every one of her scenes, but the mystery is so dull, the sub-plots irrelevant and distracting, and the teenage romance as cringy and irksome as they always are. As I said at the beginning, this film is quite obviously just not for me. It's Sherlock Holmes for teenage girls. I give it an unremarkable 5/10.""",5
MRT_,"""Fun, creative and uplifting""",25 September 2020,"""The movie is not your standard movie since it doesn't follow a complete and predictable fluid path. sure it has a predictable begin middle and end but it takes a lot of detours. Personally I can appreciate how the writer and director adopt this philosophy. I think they managed to keep me engaged throughout every scene of the movie. The movie is truly an enjoyable work of art if you let go and allow your mind to take these side stories /scenes in as well as you can, you will see a movie that depicts a unbound unchained girl live out an exciting and over the top series of events.Now finished the movie left me in a uplifted state of mind and i must say I pretty much needed that today. Needing to rate the movie I want to give it a 7.5 but needing to round it, it becomes an 8. why not round it down you ask? Even if it doesn't have a plot and storyline deserving of the great 8 it compensates a lot with sheer entertainment value.I will wach this movie again someday in the future & hope the writers and directors make make more of these moves.

weronikab,"""Falls into the ""not like other girls"" trope""",24 September 2020,"""Now, where to begin?I can't pinpoint exactly where this movie lost me; the cinematography is quite beautiful, the music is fitting, the story seems simple enough for a more family-friendly Sherlock adventure.Our leading characters are all played by very talented actors; Millie Bobby Brown, Henry Cavill, and Sam Claflin. And yet, the acting seemed off to me. After a while I came to the conclusion that the dialogue was the reason; the conversations don't sound natural, and as a result the characters look like they're reciting lines, not acting. It took me out of whatever was happening several times; I never managed to actually see the characters instead of the actors.And of course... The feminism. I am a feminist myself. I can always appreciate a well-written female character, the thing is, though, that when a character is well written, you don't need to constantly point out the movie's feminist message.There were scenes that had me rolling my eyes, such as Enola explaining how a corset is ""oppressing"". She wouldn't know that in a time where every woman wore a corset; they could have conveyed the same message by showing her discomfort whilst wearing a corset.The character of Enola doesn't feel authentic - we're always told she's this or that; intelligent, kind, good hearted, wild, but rarely see it; she doesn't seem any more intelligent than any other sixteen year old girl, nor kinder, nor wilder. It's a classic example of telling instead of showing. What we get as a result is a character that keeps talking on and on about how she doesn't want to be this or that and ""like other ladies"", but we never get to see what she DOES want. Does she enjoy all the activities she was taught by her mother, or is it just that they're the only activities she knows of? Does she really want to be different than other girls or is it just something she's been taught to believe?There's nothing wrong with following your own path and I think it's an important lesson for young girls (and boys) to learn. However, the message the movie instead conveys is ""you should try to be different than everyone else"". In reality we're all different, and walk different paths, some more accepted by society and some less; Enola's path is one of the less accepted, but we don't really know why she wants to walk it, and as a result, the story feels empty.""",6

It was well acted, the costuming was gorgeous, and the plot was interesting if slightly predictable. I may have given it a higher rating if the character of Mycroft Holmes (played by Sam Claflin) had stuck closer to the original stories' portrayal. In my eyes the character was a jerk (Claflin did a good job on the part, by the way, just not my preconception of the character). I would have been much better pleased if he had shown the same intelligence that ACD gave him in the originals.I understand it was based on a more recent novel, which I have not read, so I don't know how closely the movie adhered to the book.

cristinalinderman,"""A heartwarming and fun adaptation.""",28 September 2020,"""* (Rating 9.5/10) ** There is no end credit scene *The director Harry Bradbeer plus the crew brought a heartwarming and fun adaptation. The story sets when Enola's mother goes missing and she sets off to find her while stumbling upon a conspiracy. When I watched the trailer I knew I was going to love every second of it. This film was pure joy mainly due to the lead on breaking the fourth wall, a very entertaining perspective in which keeps us viewers more involved in the story and it worked fantastically in this kind of film. I was worried about the roles of Mycroft and Sherlock because I didn't want them to shine over Enola and thankfully they didn't. Her brothers had well-balanced roles such as enough for Enola to take her stand and make this film her own.I dare say I loved this movie more than the Sherlock Holmes films and even the Sherlock series. Not only it focuses on a strong female character the story also represents what we are struggling with since the beginning of how the society wants to control our paths making it harder for us to make our own choices. Additionally, the mother and daughter's side story was overwhelmingly moving. I like how her first fight scene was so realistic, given the fact she had never done it in the open world only training with her mother. Every breath and every punch she took made it believable. I'm looking forward to a sequel, I would love to watch another adventure, and would be so great for a mother-daughter working side by side.The composer Daniel Pemberton sets magnificently the tone of mystery with his music, a familiar atmosphere to not let us forget that this is a Holmes film.Solid performance from all the actors and I liked Henry Cavill's version as Sherlock, a more sentimental side so beautifully shown towards Enola. Millie Bobby Brown as the brilliant Enola, what an exhilarating performance, she brought the spunk, the bold, the witty, and the heroic so extraordinary and so invitingly.""",9

Her performance must have been good as Drake nearly ruined his career to get with her, unfortunately her performance with drake did not translate to the screen well. Wow she made tears come out of her eyes. What a great actress. I don't understand why she is considered a good actress.I have a lot of problems with this film but the storytelling is the worst issue. The constant fourth wall breaking just to tell the audience what's going is really annoying and lazy. The ssf part about this is that there is so little effort but into telling the story visually that if Enola wasn't explaining everything directly to me I would have been lost. There is also flashbacks every ten minutes also just to show us why Enola is the genius she is. I almost feel bad for Harry Bradbeer for directing a movie with such a incomptitent screenplay written by Jack Thorne. I was surprised to find out he doesn't have any disabilities after hearing what came out of these characters mouths.There are a couple problems with the casting and a lot of bad acting. Henry Cavill and Louis Partridge have stupid faces so I couldn't take them seriously and that's not helped by what they have to say and do. Also there isn't one good performance, I guess not everyone is awful but no one is good either, everyone had at least one hilarious line reading, Milly Bobby Brown has about fifty.Not everything is bad though, the themes are great. The foundation of the film is that women don't have equal rights with men which is obviously ridiculous, this is presented in about the most heavy handed way possible but they are good themes nonetheless. Enola Holmes is technically awful either, it has awful moments in the technical department but it's mostly average, nothing special, nothing new.I wouldn't recommend this one; it's boring after about thirty minute until the credits roll.""",4

daniellawson-14-787057,"""Feminist propaganda, with great moments""",29 September 2020,"""POSITIVES:1) The moments where the film actually gets dark and serious are fantastic, for example Mycroft and Enola's carriage ride, but far far far too brief
2) The 4 lead performances are great, Cavill as Sherlock in particular was a surprising delight and the scenes where he actually gets to show Sherlock's deductive powers are the best in the film
3) The family struggle between the Holmes siblings was very engaging and relatively true to form for a Holmes fan like myselfNEGATIVES:1) The feminist message behind the film is so on the nose that if they'd just had a screen saying ""feminism is great"" for 2 hours 3 minutes it would have been just as obvious
2) The film is all over the place in terms of its mismatch of genres: detective mystery, feminist propaganda, family drama, teen romance, comedy. All of these clashing genres makes the film so inconsistent and frankly frustrating
3) The film seems to very subtly brush over the fact that the mother was going to bomb the Houses of Parliament???
4) Seeing the annoying Viscount boy get shot at point blank range with a shotgun but then survive was so infuriating and completely ruined what could have actually been a powerful moment
5) It was so frustratingly ironic that Enola draws Mycroft as a caricature because the film portrays Mycroft as a complete caricature of a person, despite the depth and layers that the character actually has in the source material
6) As far as I'm concerned, the entire feminist message of the film suffers massively from the fact that Enola is constantly completely smitten for the good looking Viscount. The film essentially ends up telling the story of how women will always bend over backwards for good looking men. If this isn't the case, why did the Viscount have to be so good looking? Why couldn't he be 20 stone and ugly?""",6

BUT I AM EXPECTING A STORY.Many reviewers explain that this movie is intended to teens. That us, grown ups, we are not fair to the movie because we are not able to dream anymore.
When I was a teenager, I read Jules Vernes, Alexandre Dumas, les Miserables or David Copperfield.
Characters were characters, there were vilains and adventures. The plots were sometimes highly unrealistics, and so were the turns but they were set in a way that a reader will just stick to them.

There's plenty more besides, painting men as symbols of female oppression and ignorance. Even her name plays to this seudo feminist notion, Enola is ""alone"" backwards.What's really ridiculous about all of this, is its railing against history. Using an anachronistic stick to beat out a message that's already been received in more enlightened, contemporary, times.But then, in my opinion, this is what feminism has been reduced to in the Western media. A caricature, that has become more fashion than cause. There's no small irony too, that the only way this ""pitching at windmills"" can function is through the appropriation of an essentially masculine tale.in short, this could have been a charming, likeable,quirky tale, that entertained. Acting is excellent, backed by a broad cast with strong credentials. Cinematography cant be faulted either, nor quality production values.Its a shame too, as no one actually minds the tale of Sherlock Holmes taking a novel female turn. Its the spiteful lecturing that I find unattractive, as I see do many other reviewers. Rightly so too, in my opinion.5/10.""",5

However they painted sherlock as an ignorant dullard, which I dont appreciate.What Hollywood hasn't seemed to grasp is that Feminism means equality, not superiority. You dont need to dumb down Sherlock to make Enola a cool character. By doing so you are saying that you had to make a male character less than so that the female character can be on equal footing. That defeats the whole message.""",6

Movie is beautifully set and quintessentially English. I could actually see two sequels but separate. Cavill as Sherlock with Clafin as Mycroft in a more adult type film. Brown and Partridge in there own more family orientated movie like this one.The bad. Plot gets lost somewhat, it should probably have been about Brown looking for her mum and unpicking that story more comprehensively or about the Partridge family mystery (not that Partridge family ;) ). In the end I think the film tries to cram in a bit much and the film Is therefore 30 minutes too long, for me anyway.All in all though solid effort and the talent of MBB is incredible for someone so young, she is sure to be a star for many years to come. And to those moaning about feminism perhaps you need to reevaluate your own beliefs on women in film and instead embrace the talent on offer regardless of gender.

The plot was a bit simple but was still fun and entertaining - my only complaint was how one-dimensional and nasty Mycroft Holmes was depicted. Stephen Fry's Mycroft in ""Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011)"" was much more complex and likeable since his perculiarities were explained/had backstory. While Claftin did a great job, I don't think the character of Mycroft is supposed to be a baddie/villain - he's supposed to be helpful, a ""life line call"" for Sherlock when he's working on a case.

And then, despite the fact that she was dripping wet, there was no trail of water leading to where she was hiding. She talks to the camera (more cringe. this was just such an awkward part of the film) while he is trying to find her in the background. Even though her hair was wet and much of her dress was soaked there is no trail of water droplets leading to where she was hiding. It was just too stupid.There were other really bad scenes but I won't bother going into them.

Holmes, much like Bond, is a set world, set characters who act specific ways.

cemerson2012,"""Cavill is barely in this movie, which is why I give it a 4 rather than a 3.""",13 October 2020,"""First things first, this is not a Sherlock Holmes story. My only guess as to why this has any appearance of Sherlock is to try to give some context to why Enola acts the way she does. If you're watching this for the Sherlock Holmes story elements, this will not be the movie for you.If you're a casual movie viewer, you might actually enjoy Enola Holmes. If you have any appreciation or appetite for good film making, this movie will frustrate you to death.First the character development is the only bright spot in a dim offering from Netflix. They actually do a decent job with Enola's character arc and her transformation into a mini-detective of sorts. Millie Brown handles the role well in my opinion. The rest of the films execution is just dull. The writing is extremely thin, the conflict is wholly uninteresting, and it seems the writers just couldn't decide what direction the movie needed to go in. Additionally when it came time to button the story up, the ending seemed rushed and that they just forgot why Enola left her brothers in the first place.Second, I feel Netflix has a problem with their films. They spend no time setting up the world the characters live in. Just like in 'Bright', the story quickly becomes a character study with some conflict sprinkled throughout. The viewer is expected to care about the characters and their conflict without a firm understanding of their motivations or the universe in which they live. This makes for a dull and often confusing story. The premise of both Enola Holmes and Bright would work better in a long form series and remove the need for concise storytelling in under 2 hours with less than desirable payoff. Yeah they make reference to her mother a lot, but her mother becomes a seemingly forgettable subplot filled with flashbacks and other calls to previous scenes the viewer just doesn't care about.Third and possibly the worst thing about this movie. THIRD WALL BREAKS belong in Deadpool. Most of them are just plain awkward and add little to the scene.Overall, good performance from Brown.

Donatien3,"""This Girl Feels at Holmes""",27 September 2020,"""There's been countless versions of the Sherlock Holmes story, including (recently) the Benedict Cumberbatch-led UK series, the American reboot ""Elementary"", and the two Robert Downey Jr movies.Based on a series of books called ""The Enola Holmes Mysteries"", ""Enola Holmes"" puts a unique twist on the old tale in a couple of ways: firstly, it has Sherlock's younger sister Enola (Millie Bobbie Brown) as the protagonist, with Sherlock (Henry Cavill) taking a backseat, along with his older brother Mycroft (Sam Claflin).Secondly, this movie is a Netflix exclusive. While that's mainly due to COVID-19, the direct-to-streaming distribution method indicates how popular - and convenient - the streaming services have become.Enola sets off to London to find her missing mother Eudoria (Helena Bonham Carter), but soon becomes entangled with the young Viscount Tewkesbury (Louis Partridge) and a plot surrounding the historic Reform Bill vote: the Representation of the People Act 1884.Enola proves to be strong-willed as her mother (with Bonham Carter mainly appearing in bite-sized flashbacks): Eudoria taught her to fight, be independent, and to use her brain, rather than being a 'proper lady' so she could find a well-to-do husband and bear children. She's also capable of blending into her environment, from dressing like a proper lady to a common newspaper boy. It's a refreshing twist on the classic Arthur Conan Doyle tale.Enola's not afraid to break the fourth wall either, directly addressing the camera to provide relevant backstory and pose questions to the viewer, like a real detective would. There's also some impressive visuals to mix up the 'show' and 'tell' narrative devices.Even if you think you've seen every Sherlock Holmes story, ""Enola Holmes"" will surprise you with its fresh take.""",9
ObsessiveCinemaDisorder,"""Great For Teenagers Looking For A Cool Literary Heroine; Sherlock Purists May Struggle.""",27 September 2020,"""Based on the young adult novel series by Nancy Springer, Enola Holmes borrows from Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes canon but uses this newly-invented character Enola Holmes, a 16-year-old girl in the Victorian era, as its central protagonist to give female teenage readers a new literary heroine. The film adaptation works on those merits, in a similar vein to last year's Little Women from Greta Gerwig, as a revisionist feminist adaptation of a literary classic for teenagers.Coming in as a Sherlock Holmes fan, it takes a while to digest the Enola Holmes' characterization of Sherlock and Mycroft as a new addition to the ongoing canon of Sherlock Holmes onscreen interpretations. They've been rewritten here to support a new female character in their own mythology and their more mythic elements are downplayed. Sherlock Holmes purists may have a big lump to swallow ahead of them and it may not sit well with them.Henry Cavill is the most normal well-adjusted onscreen incarnation of Sherlock Holmes. There's no obsessiveness or craziness or cursedness within his mind. Sherlock's self-invented profession seems like a normal everyday working man career path. Still relatively in his Superman physique, it never seems like he starves himself until the case is closed.There's one scene where Sherlock goes to speak to Enola, who is hiding in a tree, and he just lays with his back on the tree like a young romantic lead from some Victorian novel trying to talk to an upset girl into climbing back down. I immediately thought, ""Sherlock Holmes would never lay by a tree like that oh so tenderly.""None of this matters because Sherlock's function in this story isn't meant to be another version of the legendary Mr. Holmes, but actually a big brother figure to Enola as a symbolic representation of someone who is free to pursue who they want to be in Victorian society. At times, Sherlock's intellect is set up as something for Enola to surpass. Even Mycroft, whose characterization is also not accurate to his literary origins, is a representation of conforming to Victorian traditions which makes him the antagonist.Millie Bobby Brown is charming and relishing in her lead part as Enola. She does jujitsu, archery, and receives a homeschool education in Victorian times, something probably a woman wouldn't have access to in real life, but we are living how things should be through her. Brown does a great job taking the audience through that. Her character was strongest in the earlier parts of the film when she was doing nimble-witted things in her country home speaking directly into the camera which brought a wistful frenetic youthful energy.The latter parts are where the film starts to sag and flipflopping between its subplots. The mystery that Enola has to solve is fairly simple and predictable and the story is predominantly concerned with making its revisionist feminist commentary than setting up an intricate mystery for the audience to truly sink our teeth into. Enola isn't exactly a female Sherlock Holmes. At the end of it, she felt more like an urban swashbuckler who just gets into adventures. And for that, this film doesn't feel very Sherlock Holmes at all.I was never invested in the potential love story, which the film teases us with, but what it actually is is a commentary on the convention of how we always need to include a love story in every movie. The film seemed to be so allergic to the prospect of its female protagonist falling in love for a boy as that would entirely nullify the film's premise as that would make Enola solely dependent on her male béau.If this was the case, why didn't the writers just have Enola help out another girl who, too, is feeling repressed as a woman in Victorian society? In broad terms, perhaps a nurse who wants to be a chance at being certified a doctor named Johanna Hamisha Watson? For that very reason, instead of Sherlock and Mycroft, what the film really needed more of was Eudoria Holmes, the mother played by Helena Bonham Carter. It seemed like that would be the actual dialogue the film would have wanted to have.Enola Holmes is a cute charming romp and will play best for the young adult age group who thinks Enola is a cool heroine and that her fourth-wall-breaking is cool and edgy. They will go to college, take a literature class, find better idols, and read better fourth-wall-breaking later down the line. If a primary or middle school girl watches this and feels empowered by it, then it has done its job. Hopefully, if this becomes a franchise, as a mystery fan, personally I'd want more intricately crafted mystery plots.For my own personal tastes, I much prefer if Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss gave us a Eurus Holmes spinoff from Benedict Cumberbatch's BBC Sherlock. You know, the youngest Holmes sibling who is so super intelligent, she is borderline murderous. Eurus would find her missing mother within a prison-supervised 5 minutes on the Internet.""",6
jeremy_kramer,"""Cute, Entertaining, Doesn't condemn terrorism""",27 September 2020,"""Well cast, well acted, well shot, etc. The usual compliments.The only problem is the fact that (spoiler warning)... Enola's mother is heavily implied to be engaging in acts of terrorism, and the writing of the film does not condemn her. While we normally associate terrorism with religious extremism, the FBI actually defines it (briefly) as the use of violence to achieve political or social objectives. This is true whether that objective is jihad or women's suffrage.There is a warehouse full of actual bombs directly linked to Mrs. Holmes in the film and her only response to it is ""we have to make noise if we wish to be heard"" (not an exact quote). She does, in the final scene of the film, admit that her daughter found a more elegant solution in getting the reform bill passed, but in no way admits the clear evil of her own chosen methodology.""",5

scocasso,"""I was hoping for more""",27 September 2020,"""The costumes, sets, settings, etc. looked fantastic. It's a kid's movie, so I wasn't very invested in historical accuracy, I can overlook that as long as the story, dialogue, etc. is good. I mean, hey, we all have an imagination and at one time we were meant to watch actors on a stage with a painted backdrop and imagine they were in a castle, or in a field, it's really all about the story and the acting for me and all else is merely fluff. Don't get me wrong, I love eye-candy, and there is a lot of that in this movie. I was looking forward to a good mindless adventure where Sherlock and his brother were mainly background characters, so again, I didn't invest much in those two characters, I wanted to follow this girl on her adventure.At the onset we learn she was raised by a single mother (widowed) who never worked, but revealed later, lived on the financial support of one of her two brothers (who both abandoned her). Yet, she's portrayed as a strong independent woman. She raises her daughter, training her as if raising her to be Jane Bond in weapons, hand-to-hand combat, world knowledge, etc., but to what end? Oh, sorry, not Jane Bond, Joan of Arc. In the first two minutes there were already hints of 'we can do and be anything we want here,' (even dress up as men) but not... outside of this estate. I thought that this would play into the societal expectations of her and make her into an outsider to normal society, which might make for interesting interactions with the outside world. But instead, that's not what they made of this. They were laying the foundations for something else.It turns out that her mother's secret was that she is a government agent and a spy... ha ha, no, nothing so interesting, it turns out that her mother is a terrorist, plotting something which requires multiple bombs. Why? ""Perhaps she wants to change the world,"" speculates Sherlock. ""Perhaps it's a world that needs changing,"" replies Enola. What are they talking about? They don't say, specifically, but we already saw a bundle of flyers for ""Women's Suffage"" and Enola looks at the camera with a sly smile as if to say, ""Ooh yeah!!"" Ah, when that was revealed, it was all too much, all of the foolish bumbling stupid inept male characters fall right into place. All of the remarks about female clothing being a prison, and having to go to a finishing school, well, putting her in a prison within a prison. All of the gendered remarks and inferences... oh, we were rolling our eyes as this ball rolled on getting larger and larger as it went. Her mother was a suffragette, and of course ""they"" (the police) were looking for her, because she was likely responsible for bombings which may or may not have killed people. What a hero. This movie is trying to rewrite history, but careful not to say much outright. It's all blatant inferences.Men were not allowed to vote, that was left up to the aristocracy. Even up to 1918, not all men could vote, only property owners. Eventually, men and women who served in the armed forces were allowed to vote (those that survived, that is). Eventually, it was extended to all men in 1918, but not all women, because men were obligated to fight and die for their country in exchange for voting rights, women were not obligated to fight and die for their country, but voting rights were extended to women who occupied a premises of a certain yearly value, and other women as well. It wasn't until 1928 that all women were able to vote. So, only ten years after all men were able to vote, and it was men that voted to allow all women to be able to vote without any obligation or responsibilities to their country, unlike men who do have such in exchange for their right to vote, to this very day. If men were really women hating misogynists and women really had no rights or freedoms etc. and were slaves to men... women would never get the right to vote, or any rights at all. Ridiculous fiction of which so many blatant hypocritical notions are evident in this movie.In fact, men were responsible for women. A single man, such as Sherlock, would be very much frowned upon and it would be very difficult to find any employment, as a single man is a man with no future, a man who is basically worthless and most importantly, a man who is not supporting a woman... not supporting his country. For every single man, there is a woman not being supported. These were very real pressures on men. A single man would also find it difficult to gain entry to university. If a woman committed a crime, the husband was responsible. He was responsible for her debts, her taxes, and even after divorce he was still responsible for her. Mycroft Holmes, as the elder brother, was legally responsible for Enola's mother, his sister, and that is why she never worked and he supported her financially all those years. Enola's mother COULD have worked, but why work when you don't have to? I wouldn't. Mycroft Holmes was a government employee, i.e. he had a job. He moved away to the city to work and in turn support Enola's mother. I also wouldn't feel comfortable taking someone's hard earned money and giving nothing in return.Anyway, it's just sad that Millie Bobby Brown (a 16 year old; a young impressionable teenager) is being indoctrinated into believing and spreading such misinformation about the past to her audience, many of whom are also young impressionable kids who might believe what they see in the movies to hold some truth.""",5

I didn't read the info really I just saw the trailer and for some reason I thought it was going to be a series and then I realized it was a film once it started but still in the beginning I was so eager to finish it thinking that it was going to be great! Sadly it is nothing comparable to any Sherlock versions I have seen. As a feminist myself I was actually intrigued to see where they were going to go with their storyline once it had come into place, but it was just so bad! There was no capturing component about her deductions as some type of female detective and they had every chance to make it that way hello? She is Sherlocks sister and she's supposed to be smart and and witty because of her mothers teaching but it focus so much more on physical fighting rather than her intelligence in solving a mystery. Sherlocks character was ridiculous and he made me cringe I can't believe they chose him and his lies were so dumb And in no way add a Sherlock level more of just a normal detective. I'm pretty sure they just chose him because he is handsome which is really Innoway contradictory towards the feminist way my biggest complaint was the ending result the entire time she is looking for her mother right? In fact that was in the trailer and it is the main plot of the movie besides a boy that she randomly met and fell in love within 10 seconds.And yet she never solved the mystery of where her mother was her mother just appeared somehow knowing where she was in a random hotel room and was there to find her she did not find her mother and it was so disappointing as a film. There was so much potential having Millie Bobby Brown as the main character as well as other supporting roles including Helena Bonham Carter and yet it was a complete failure! Included in that level of potential I didn't think the feminist line was so bad. In fact I thought it had an awesome creative framework to put in a great film and like I keep saying I was very disappointed.""",5

With bad press in the press on Millie Bobby Brown due to her sexualizing demeanour (not my words) I didn't think the casting was great. Henry cavill steals the film and perhaps a re telling of Sherlock with him at the helm alone would've been a better angle. You get the impression that Millie was trying to emulate Natalie Portman.

Sickpuppy365,"""Enola was just a Millie-cent bystander""",14 October 2020,"""It became painfully obvious early on in the film that I am not in the target audience age range... And possibly also not in the gender range...
Never-the-less, I approached it with as open a mind as someone who has read all of Sir A.C. D's books, and who has also seen far too many man-bashing reboots of late.
Millie Bobby Brown is absolutely charming as always thus far in her burgeoning career, conveying Enola's sassy, and resolute character with aplomb.
All the older folk played their parts competently, even if some (looking at you Cavill) raised the rebuffing ire of all the die-hard S. Holmes fan(atic)s
I'm pretty glad they didn't write Enola's character as an African-American/ Asian lesbian transgender Muslim velociraptor as is the current trend in Hollywood... I think it's enough that she's just a strong young girl trying to figure out who she is and at the same time escape the shadows of her big brothers... So hopefully future installments in this possible franchise will concentrate on developing Enola's deductive skills, giving her more challenging cases to solve and fleshing-out her character arc... Without selling out to the genocidal gender crusade I'm expecting.
I will watch this space with an wary eye for further installments...""",6
IonicBreezeMachine,"""A great performance from Millie Bobby Brown elevates this YA franchise starter""",11 October 2020,"""Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown), younger sister of Sherlock and Mycroft, has lived in the countryside all her life with her mother Eudoria (Helena Bonham Carter) learning all manner of unconventional skills and sciences. On the eve of Enola's 16th birthday Eudoria disappears which sets Enola off on an adventure to find her, picking up a runaway Marquis Tewkesberry (Louis Partridge) and evading her oldest brother Mycroft's attempts to send her to a boarding school.Enola Holmes is based on the eponymous series of books by Nancy Springer, chronicling the heroine's adventures geared toward a YA audience. I've not read the series myself, and cannot speak towards the faithfulness of the adaptation, but as a movie it's a respectable start to a clearly intended franchise anchoring by a solid performance by Stranger Things' Millie Bobby Brown.Brown is an absolute delight playing Enola and not only brings the intellectual prowess one would expect from a teen sleuth related to endearingly timeless detective Sherlock Holmes, but also gives the role a sense of humor and energy that helps to bring the character to life. The movie is also given solid direction by veteran TV director Harry Bradbeer (killing Eve, Fleabag) and keeps the film moving with a sense of forward momentum that manages to maintain audience engagement. The supporting cast are also quite good. Despite being essentially a glorified cameo, Henry Cavill (The Witcher, Man of Steel) embodies the character well and has some very nice character based moments between himself and Brown where he brings a level of sweetness and humanity to Sherlock that isn't usually seen. Louis Partridge is also quite good playing Tewkesbury, a runaway Marquis who finds himself tangled up in Enola's own complications which leads to them repeatedly crossing paths throughout the movie. This is Partridge's first major role having had some minor roles in films like Pan and a deleted scene in Paddington 2, and he shows himself to be a charismatic an appealing actor whom I hope to see more of.Unfortunately despite being relatively solid the movie does still have some drawbacks. The case that Enola embarks upon I didn't feel to be especially engaging. There's essentially two cases in the movie 1) Eudoria 's disappearance and 2) who is trying to kill Tewkesbury. The cases are tenuously related to a degree, but the first case is basically dropped in favor of pursuing the second one later in the film and it makes the film feel somewhat less like a full story than it should. This wouldn't be that big an issue were the case more involving, but unfortunately the case is not only overly easy to solve, it doesn't much in the way of intrigue relating to it either.Enola Holmes is an entertaining mystery adventure that is geared towards a family audience. The film features good performances across the board as well as strong direction from a first time feature director, but its story unfortunately isn't as engaging as one would expect from a feature carrying the iconic Holmes name. Despite these drawbacks there's a lighthearted sense of fun and adventure to be had and should prove entertaining to its target audience.""",7
snoozejonc,"""Entertaining but could have been better""",10 October 2020,"""Teenager Enola Holmes runs away from the guardianship of her older brother to search for her missing mother.This film has a lot going in its favour. Excellent lead performance from 'Stranger Things' star Millie Bobby Brown, great cinematography, fun graphics and a strong theme of female empowerment running through it.I'm one of those forty year old males who this movie was not aimed at but I enjoyed all of the above and am happy that both my daughters have stronger female characters to see compared to ones my generation grew up watching.Unfortunately i did find the story a bit long winded and when Enola addressed the camera it felt a bit gimmicky.It's often difficult when mixing a plot with exposition about a character's beginnings, but this one mixes two mysteries and origin details into a two hour run time. There were a number of scenes that brought the momentum to a halt.As for 'breaking the forth wall' as film buffs like to say, I think it worked well in 'Deadpool' because the dialogue was so funny, but personally I don't think it works here. Maybe it is something different for viewers that have not seen this type of thing before but I don't think the story needs it. I felt the same when watching 'House Of Cards'.The vibe of the film feels more Marvel than Sherlock Holmes, with its jujitsu, funky graphics and action sequences. I suspect this is something studio executives demand these days in order to maximise profit. It's not a bad thing in this case as enjoyment of the movie might prompt people to explore Nancy Springer's novels or even Arthur Conan Doyle original Sherlock Holmes books. That being said the Sherlock who appears in this movie is portrayed by a good looking, muscular star of the superhero genre who gives the character a sensitive side, clearly another marketing decision.Overall I found it entertaining but it's probably not one I'd rewatch.""",6

sj7075-292-151006,"""Boring, tame and an hour too long""",5 October 2020,"""Ok, so this is a new take on Sherlock Holmes. Enola Holmes is the brat little sister of the great Sherlock Holmes (Henry Cavill) and the eldest brother Mycroft Holmes.Murder, mystery, you know the story, right?Well, this time around the mystery isn't anything as exciting. There are a few mysteries in one in this story, two of them present themselves in the opening 15 minutes of the movie, the last comes much later along.The problem is, the mysteries are pretty tame by Sherlock standards. Finding out the mysteries with the film, feels incredibly stretched, as too many times through this movie, we see flashbacks that just add nothing to the story or mystery in clues. You don't try and predict the mystery as the story progresses, you just sit quietly expecting a grand reveal at the end, but it never comes. There are plenty of feminist, woke parts to this movie. An all womens self defence class run by a black woman, above a tea shop? Should have been left on the cuttin room floor, as that only served as a minor clue source that took up too much time.Between 4 of us adults watching this film, we struggled to maintain focus on the film, the mystery to it all, fairly predictable. So there is no grand reveal, and neither is there a point to the main mystery, as apparently it wasn't a bread crumb trail left to follow (despite it clearly being so) as there was nothing missing, it was just past off as a normal the ""twist"" to the end.The other storylines being sewn up are VERY predictable, but relate to characters that aren't even apart of the film as characters, so its like ""oh the maid did it"" even though she had one scene in the entire film where she didn't even speak. So weak!Enola is funny at times, but mostly pretty annoying. She breaks the 4th wall, talking to the audience at times, but it comes across as trying to be too clever, where you're left thinking ""why can't some of that humour and sense of reality be put into the actual script and dialogue of the characters?"" She's both a super strong fighter, and a coward running away from trouble she could have previously handled. Sherlock has barely a part in this movie, Henry Cavill making zero impact in this, so if you're a fan, you'll be yearning for more. The main Bad Guy? Well, he's sadly no mystery either as apparent early on through the movie. The movie tends to take a dump regularly on men, with female characters constantly referring to men as useless. Part of the story seems to almost justify murder to push an agenda of womens rights. It didn't feel right towards the end of the movie the message being put out, seems to be its ok to hate on men, and hurt people to push your agenda when its feminism leading the kill.And my god, this movie is boring! Was easily an hour too long at 2 hours, where this could have easily been a Christmas 1 hour special wrapped up very neatly, if it had brung in the characters played by stars to make it shine more. They had nothing to add to this movie.""",3

fanouraki_niki,"""Save it for next time...""",27 September 2020,"""(The movie is a fun watch for when bored, with a lot of clever ideas. There are parts that I would have enjoyed if i wasn't an immense Sherlock Holmes fan. This review is based on MY point of view which I do not claim that is the best one.)
Enola Holmes is not the worst movie, but there is a big (huge) space for improvements. The storyline had potentials, especially as far as the mother-daughter bond is concerned. I found some parts totally unnecessary and others clever, but not well-expressed.
First of all, the political aspect of the film could have been reached in much more depth in many ways. Enola was a young girl brought up to be a promising fighter in the war between women and society itself. Martial arts and tomboy manners aren't enough to express this exception. It would have been probably better if we saw Enola actually interacting with powerful older men, so that the contrast is even more distinguishable. In this case, the Duke's uncle scene wasn't adequate and the hired murderer served no political meaning.
Enola's relationship with her brothers was rather exaggerated and boring, not to mention written-in-a-borED-way. Mycroft was purposelessly distant and strict and Sherlock absolutely uninvolved, but in the end seemed really thoughtful (it was all mixed and baffling). I understand that the movie tried to focus on men's pressure on women and it's clear that some exaggerated parts were created for point-making reasons. Nonetheless, Enola being so repressed to enter the boarding school by the Holmes brothers was kind of contradicting and senseless, in my opinion.
Apart from all that, when having SUCH a masterpiece as a background (forever thankful to Arthur Conan Doyle) you can't but take advantage of it! Sherlock followers and the majority of the ones who watched the film probably couldn't wait to ""meet"" the mystery portrayed and Enola's (or hers and her brothers') genius way of solving it. The plot was really poor in this field as the extraordinary roles of Sherlock and Mycroft were HARDLY used, and Enola's inherited talent wasn't featured as a priority at all.
The character of the young lady's love affair was rationally created, as it provokes interest to anyone and it was received as a chance to turn the roles of the ""prince-saving-the-girl"" stereotype (which has also turned into a stereotype, but what can you say). What I found really unnecessary was the scene where the boy is being shot, but isn't dead after all... it was a waste of time and dignity. His backstory, moreover, was slightly mentioned, not to keep the mystery, but as a sign of bored writing. The ""plot-twist"" about the murder attempts was not such a twist, as he would have been killed for the same reason Enola had assumed earlier. The only difference was the family member behind all this, big deal... Tewkesbury and Enola's ending (and duration) , after all, was absolutely indifferent. I recognize the need of the writers to have the girl end up with no man's support, but their ending could have been a chance to prove this indifference wrong.
The mum-daughter bond problems start with the fact that the mum should have known the chance of her daughter's pressure form her brothers! I mean, wouldn't she know her son's moves since he takes over his sister's custody? It was a stupid move of the mother, so the whole plot based on this move isn't intriguing at all, to me... Their getting back together was also pretty awkward to watch, since we hadn't see them together in the present before and they were both quite distant. Personally, I wasn't persuaded that the mother's motives were the ones mentioned when she apologized nor were Enola's...
The cast was really badly matched to the roles, unfortunately. Helen B. Carter was misused, as she's one of the most talented actresses of all time, but was given a poorly written role... The amazing role of Mycroft has nothing to do with Sam Claflin's- which I adore- interpretation and Henry Cavill seemed like he didn't know who the heck that Sherlock guy the he was playing is. Millie Bobbie Brown played quite decently, but she could have been even better. The acting quality was bad in many scenes, but I can't understand whose fault that is...
All in all, the whole idea of a third Holmes child is really very interesting and smart, but this attempt went wrong... I strongly believe that the main cause of this failure is the much-promising background of the storyline, so no hard feelings!

It was only at the end, when the brilliant, enlightened Holmes mother, using all her powers of deduction and logic, concluded that the most reasonable course of action was domestic terrorism - a bombing. Because in a world progressing too slowly for women's rights, blowing up the House of Lords - while they were convened for a vote - would of course bring about the desired change. ""Give us what we want or we'll kill you.""That was the great message from the genius Holmes matriarch.

Henry Cavill as Sherlock was very much in the background of this film.

These people missed the point of the movie.It was about a sixteen year old, intelligent and empowered young girl developing out of her sheltered life. There was many complex characters, including the men. Many of the men in the movie represented the general perception of women in the day, whereas other men showed a different perspective. It didn't feel aggressively feminist because the suffragette movement was the underlying notion of the movie- it fit perfectly. The characters were fun and the way Enola interacted with the audience and the cameras was a great convention that not many movies use.There is, of course, down sides to every film, as is the nature of subjective art. For instance, it was very historically inaccurate in some aspects such as the position and treatment of POC, but 1) the movie was about progressing and changing the world and so they needed to include people who are a part of the revolution and 2) if they didn't include any POC they would be getting backlash for it. I enjoyed the story and the inclusion of POC but still knew that wasn't the reality of the times. It's a fictional movie.Overall, I watched it while completing some writing and I found myself drawn to the movie more than my writing.

Millie Bobbie Brown is a fun female protagonist and remains excellent teenage role model. If you didn't like it ask yourself why? Maybe the social/political themes did rest easy with you.

Not the focus of this review. As someone who is a semester away from my film degree, I love watching movies and analyzing all of the parts that make it up.First, I'll start with the good. The cinematography, lighting, set dec, wardrobe, and props were very well done (although with a Netflix budget, they probably spared no expense). The camera work/placement was also pretty good. I could see the directors style in some of the shots, and some of it worked well. As a big fan of lighting and cinematography, they did a pretty good job with that too. The quick zoom in on the item they are focusing on is classic Sherlock Holmes.Now for the bad. What even is this story? We really had to wait until the last 5 minutes to find her mom? So many wild tangents in the story. They all tried to tie them in, but they fell flat. And Enola didn't really have a a good development arc. She started off pretty smart, witty, and skilled, and only mildly improved. Also, they were trying to make her a strong independent woman, but then totally 180-ed that with her romance, making her seem like a damsel in love. AND THE CAMERA NARRATION WAS SO POINTLESS! This ain't dora the explorer. It's lazy, forced exposition.""",5
abellha-89730,"""An honest review from someone who's not a misogynist""",24 September 2020,"""It was alright. Not perfect. Not terrible. Just alright. 5/10 sums it up perfectly.
The coloring is beautiful, and the music has moments of brilliance.
The performances are adequate, nothing special. Obviously this is aimed at kids so it doesn't really matter.
Alright let's get down to the politics of it all.
Feminism existed back in the day so, get over it? Idk. Obviously it is exaggerated a little and very heavy handed. I'm a staunch feminist and it made me cringe a few times. It beats you over the head. ""You're a man when I tell you you're a man."" Seriously?
Racially, it's barely diverse. There's like, 2 bipoc actors so of course everyone's in a tizzy. First of all, bipoc people also existed back then, and to barr them from roles that they wouldn't have played at that time is, well, racist. Do you get it?
Anyway, it's fine. A fun kid flick, but even I, a young adult woman, was bored at times. The movie was far too long and the romance subplot was entirely useless. Honestly, I wouldn't watch again, but if you need something to turn on for the kids and not really pay attention to, it's fine.""",5
marksa-42219,"""Not enough but it's alright""",23 September 2020,"""For the first time, the life of Sherlock Holmes' sister is mainly filmed without being a rogue little part of the life of the legendary detective Sherlock, the film is intellectually good and critical and the storytelling style is very smooth and entertaining as Enola addresses the audience directly at every part from the movie and this gives the viewer a feeling as if Accompany her in her journey within the story.The film is an OK level in all respects, and it did not dive into the correct environment for the time in which it is filmed, but rather it was satisfied with the basics. There is no big discrepancy between the performance of the cast as a whole, despite the presence of an important ones, but they didn't have enough space or appropriate standards for creativity and this is due to the directing and his focus on supporting Millie Bobby Brown, but it was at the expense of the perfection of the film. and the young actress wasn't able to lead the role Sufficiently, but was only good.I think that Henry Cavill in Sherlock Holmes is the worst Sherlock Holmes ever, although his role was minor and small, but a character like Holmes should not be tampered with its importance, and this is what both the director and the actor did.
In the end, the film is considered an initial introduction of Enola Holmes' character to the world of cinema from a wide perspective and has fulfilled the job in an acceptable and entertaining manner, no more.Regarding Netflix production, I did not raise expectations in the first place.""",5

treckosentry,"""As dull as Captain Marvel and the Charlie's Angels reboot...""",7 October 2020,"""Enola Holmes, 4/10. A painful movie to watch. It ultimately butchers the character of the two siblings, Sherlock and Mycroft into useless, stupid, slow incompetent characters so that the movie can showcase the protagonist's (Enola) intellectual prowess; though it fails since the movie isn't about her wit but more on about her mastery of a single move ""The Corkscrew"" to finally defeat the hitman that has been troubling Enola and Tewkesbury. A feminist movie that gives Enola a lot of plot armor that feels as shallow as Brie Larson's Captain Marvel. The portrayal of Mycroft Holmes is inaccurate to the extreme: He's shown as someone who's skinny and was said by other characters as not as clever as Sherlock, but anyone who read the books knows that Mycroft is cleverer than the impressive detective. Henry Cavill's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes is as sad and boring as Bella from Twilight; for a character that can unveil anyone's secrets and life story in a single observation, Sherlock is as dull as a rock and not as talkative like he is from Conan-Doyle's novels. And Henry Cavill shows a character that is sympathetic, kind, and, well mannered, the complete opposite of a calculating, rude, cunning, sharp, and completely aware in an investigation. What also upsets me is the absence of the friend and companion of Sherlock, Dr. Watson. He was completely denied of his existence and makes the story more contradictory since Watson is the one that writes the adventures of the duo and made the public aware of them. The movie was centered on finding her mother and who she really is, but the movie abandons her investigation when she uncovers the plans of her supposedly clever mother to create a relationship with Tewkesbury, solve the mystery, and forces us, viewers, to witness a plot twist that is laughable and felt like something written by M. Night Shyamalan. Enola and Tewkesbury's character is as one-dimensional as the other ineffective feminist-propaganda movies like the characters from the Charlie's Angels reboot. It's meh.""",4
AndrewRMButcher,"""Meaningless, Pointless, Insulting""",6 October 2020,"""This film could have been a great adventure, but the biggest letdown of this film was the sexism. I understand women feel misrepresented in films and want more of the spotlight, and we should as film makers create more diversity, with more diverse cast etc. And women feel insulted by films and TV when they are not the focus. But that doesn't mean you can completely flip it onto men. If it's about equality, why are we accepting women characters referring to the male characters as 'useless' and other derogatory terms. Not all men are 'useless boys'. This is demeaning for a bloke and I'm fed up with seeing it in every film made for feminist reasons. Stereotypes of women aren't allowed, so why are stereotypes of men? With Mycroft being a horrible person and so controlling? To please a certain crowd by showing the viewer that the world apparently doesn't need men, as Enola doesn't need a father or her brothers, the men are not needed. I wonder if I made a Sherlock Holmes film with that in it against women. Without that, this film would have just made it, with an exceptional cast to fill the roles. The sense of adventure was great, the only other things that made this film lack were the unnecessary fourth wall breaking and the structure of the film. We seem to completely switch narratives at one point, which is very random and it does jar out quite big. Fourth wall breaking is risky, as it is done so seamlessly in Deadpool without fault, it can be hard to replicate, and it has to fit the story and the character. But for this film, it didn't work. It didn't suit her character and all these bits felt pointless and cringe worthy, not funny or smart or clever. It wouldn't have even worked with Sherlock, because that's not his character type. I find with adaptations, it only works if the source material is the same. So apart from the constant insults to men, meaningless fourth wall breaking and complete change in narrative, the film was alright. Henry Cavill was a great Sherlock.""",3

Tony_Fresh_Reviews,"""This might be the most jacked Sherlock Holmes has ever been.""",24 September 2020,"""This movie had so much potential, but it was completely average. For everything that I liked, there was something I didn't. Enola Holmes, played by Millie Bobby Brown, was excellent. She was tenacious, likable, empowering, and quick-witted. Henry Cavill as a super-jacked Sherlock Holmes was incredible and I wanted more. Ultimately, the best part of this movie is the Holmes family.It's when we draw our focus elsewhere do we run into problems. What I thought would be a fun adventure of a daughter finding her missing mother turned into some Disney Channel love story. We focus too much time on Enola and Lord Farquaad (or whatever his name was), which slows this movie down to an agonizing drag. The movie is largely unfocused spending more time beating you over the head with its message than writing a compelling or coherent story. It's a movie you shouldn't think too hard about, but considering its source material, you would think the writing would have been more clever. If not for the amazing cast, this movie would have been a chore to get through.Score: 5 out of 10

IQuacke,"""Great Ideas, Bad Execution""",24 September 2020,"""An enjoyable film, great to watch with your family.
But, I am far too disappointed in what this movie could have been. You have great actors, simple, but great storyline and many motives this film wanted to portray to its audience. I quite can't find exactly what went wrong there, but I may have a few things in my mind. First off, I didn't like how they ''tried'' to put as many topics and messages into this one amalgam of mess. Actors did a decent job, I loved the performances of all actors, especially Millie, who I think really put her soul into this.
So, we had an unnecessary love scene, which had no reason to be there whatsoever, then this film became too feministic for me, but I didn't mind it at all actually, but then I remembered I was too focused on Enola finding her mother, but during the film I feel like it wasn't really focused on that, rather they tried to show the feminism and their other unnecessary thoughts. The ending was very disappointing for me.
Music fit, but didn't really stand out to me. I don't know what to think of the clothes, they fit into the era, but I just simply didn't like the choices for the outfits, personally.
Also, was it just me or the lighting was a bit off. Anyways, nice movie, but it's not a must watch.""",6
willbentley,"""Fairly harmless""",23 September 2020,"""The Holmes name does tend to carry an expectation of the film being centred around a complicated, developed mystery, however this is not the case on this occasion.

I also found the story a bit more difficult to follow. But Millie Bobby Brown, Henry Cavil and Sam Claflin played really well in this movie, but I would have liked to see more of Herny Cavil's Sherlock Holmes because there was not to much of it in the movie. The action was okay for what it was and the humor was too much at times. It was entertaining and I enjoyed watching it and I will like a sequel (which they have already set up a bit). I give this movie a 6/10 for the acting and the entertainment.""",6
benmundie,"""Enjoyable but Nothing Special!""",15 October 2020,"""'Enola Holmes' is a fun adventure picture which is full of an empowering feminist message. The acting is fantastic with the standouts being Millie Bobby Brown as the titular character, Henry Cavill as 'Sherlock Holmes' and Sam Claflin as 'Mycroft Holmes'. The writing is endearing and suits the story they're telling and how they're portraying the legendary Sherlock Holmes. Henry Cavill brings something new to the role in the most recent adaption of the famous character. The story has obvious direction with Enola searching for her mother, Eudoria, (Helen Bonham Carter). With multiple twists involved which don't always land but do for the most part. The film paints a picture where Enola is the heroine, then convinces younger viewers that she doesn't need to be constrained by the rules of her family. The relationship between Enola and Tewksbury seems realistic and they bounce off each other well. However, the film isn't perfect, the comedy doesn't always land and seems quite forced at times. The emotional scenes, especially at the end between the main protagonist and her mother, lack logic and it feels like we missed a pivotal scene at the end. In the middle of the second act the story drags as they take Enola out of her quest to put her into a random side story. Some aspects of the world are incredibly unrealistic, in particular, when Linthorn (Burn Gorman) survives despite being in the centre of a massive explosion.
Overall, the acting really carries the film and Millie Bobby Brown is perfect in the role. This is an enjoyable flick for people that have a free two hours.""",7
srivastavasanskar-28251,"""It was excellent but still not good enough.""",2 October 2020,"""Because I liked, no loved, Enola Holmes, it is rather unfortunate that I have to begin this review by saying that it stands in a long line of movie adaptations which do not live up to their source material. The movie alters a lot of characters, rather radically, like Lady Eudoria, who is noted to be an unexpressive woman in Nancy Springer's canon, as opposed to the loving mother in the movie. The other change is Sherlock Holmes himself. In the books, Sherlock's views are perhaps just a mellowed down version of Mycroft's, who, it is to be noted, is not really written as the evil brother. The story itself, undergoes serious changes to make it much more dramatic for a motion pricture. Suffice to say, a lot of content from the books gets lost in the translation.After the rant, because I've just read Springer's novels and loved them, as could not digest the changes for a short while, it is unfair to compare the movie with its source as in doing so, a lot of artistic liberty gets compromised. When treated as a standalone, with no comparisons, Enola Holmes is a full package of mystery and humour with a serious message and a nice take on familial values and and a veiled sort of romance, fit for a movie set in the nineteenth century. Enola is an extremely intriguing character and everyone hopes to see more of her. Henry Cavill's take on Sherlock Holmes is rather refreshing. The highlight, for me was, The Viscount Tewksbury, Marquess of Basilwether, who was simply very entertaining and engaging side character.Regarding the actors, all of them were excellent, if a little too good looking for their respective characters. The format of storytelling was good too, though for some, I've heard, it was irritating, though that is a matter of personal preference.But one element, no, two of them, from the books, which were missing from the movie felt unforgiveable. One, the loss of Enola's innocence when see actually witnesses the real world and notices that there are two sides of London, one for the rich and the other one is the abjectly poor and constantly ignored East end. Nancy Springer's portrayal of the himalayan divide between two sections of London felt sorely missing from the movie because it is such an integral part of Enola and contributes so much to her character. The second, and the one that is more controversial is the martial feminism of modern times that's been thrust into the audience's faces, igonoring any and all social norms of the time, with the characters behaving like normal modern people. It replaces a softer and much more acceptable version, which, instead of proclaiming superiority of one gender, instead revels in the gift of womanhood. In the books, Enola vows never to wear a trouser because one, it would be entirely too clichè and two, because it would show that she feels dishonoured to be a woman. Enola, in Springer's version, revels in the gift of being a woman and does not consider doing 'manly' things to be a necessary element for the empowerment of women. She instead deals with more relateable issues (for women of the time), like tight corsets and strigent social expectations.This movie is worth watching and deserves a sequel, but honestly, a little disappointing for a book reader, for had it followed its source material more closely, it could have been so much more. Overall, I'd like the readers to draw their own conclusions after watching the movie, and recommend them strongly, to read the books as well.""",7

Even if one doesn't especially fall for the movie it is the kind one would stay until the end to see how it goes down.
Henry Cavill and Helena Bonham Carter give some good weight to the cast, but in not very obvious way, and Millie Bobby Brown plays very well the main character so in the end one has a nice film to watch as a brake from more heavier productions.

Even though the little love story was sewed into the main plot, but I often found it taking huge chunks of the movie runtime. Their love story was arguably distracting and unnecessary for the movies main plot.Enola Holmes also falls short with their character development for character such as Sherlock Holmes and his brother. Even though the movie makes it clear that they have been maintaining a distance from their mother and sister, the story doesn't care to explain their reasons.

This charming coming-of-age adventure movie is family-friendly entertainment that was acquired by Netflix shortly after the worldwide pandemic arrived. It's based on the Nancy Springer book series called, ""The Enola Holmes Mysteries."" If you enjoy playing the Scrabble Game, you'll get a kick out of the mystery Enola has to solve with her unique gift of unscrambling ciphers.Directed by Harry Bradbeer and written by Jack Thorne, this movie comes with a warning. There is a LOT of social justice warrior messaging. For some viewers, that will kill the fun journey of the film. Feminism is one of the movie's biggest themes, as the movie is set in England in the early 1920s when Woman's Suffrage was a dangerous endeavor. For those who don't mind all of that, it's a lot of fun.TIPS FOR PARENTS:

""The future is up to us!"" - Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown)THINGS I LIKED:
Millie Bobby Brown is absolutely perfect as the spunky Enola Holmes, sister to the famous Sherlock Holmes. She earned a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress for her role in Stranger Things when she was only 13 years old! She's also the youngest person EVER to be featured on the TIME 100 list. Needless to say, she's talented and an absolute delight to watch in this movie. Did you know she's actually deaf in one ear? She has been trained in boxing in real life, making her believable in the action sequences. Enola breaks the 4th wall from the very beginning of the movie, which some viewers will think is annoying, but I thought it was endearing. It kind of reminded me of Matthew Broderick's banter to the audience in the movie Ladyhawke . I love that movie. Some critics have also complained that Millie Bobby Brown overacts in this film, but again, that's just one of the elements of the storytelling that I thought was cute.
Helena Bonham Carter is such a talented treasure. Another movie where she plays an unconventional mother is the fun and quirky The Young and Prodigious T.S. Spivet. I just discovered it the other night on Amazon! How did I miss that little gem?
The exuberant musical score by Daniel Pemberton is spirited in all the right ways and supports the energy of the movie.
I adore both leading men: Henry Cavill and Sam Claflin. Sadly, there has been some controversy and a lawsuit involving the Trust of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's estate regarding Henry Cavill's empathetic version of Sherlock Holmes, from what they say damages the source material and reputation. That sounds so British, right? Awwww, Henry. We love you and your heartwarming smolder. Unfortunately, I hear that a lot of his lines were cut in the film. He is a small part of the movie, but I'm glad he's there when he's allowed to be.
If the train looks familiar, it's because it's the same make and model used in all of the Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone franchise! If you're a fan of those movies (who isn't?) you'll also get a kick out of seeing three Harry Potter cast members reunited in this film: Helena Bonham Carter, Fiona Shaw, and Frances de la Tour.
There's one of those Pretty Woman ""you're not good enough to shop here"" moments in the movie.
The movie moves at a brisk pace, providing energy throughout the entire film.
It's certainly timely as one of its topics is the importance of voting.
If you enjoy the movie, you'll be happy that it ends with a hint of a sequel.
Fantastic production quality with great costumes and set design.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
The movie has a strong feminist message and gets very preachy. For example, Enola's mother counsels her, ""Don't be thrown off by other people, especially MEN!"" It definitely reveals the writer's and director's political views or at least their attempts to jump on the female empowerment platform that appears in almost every movie nowadays.
Some are upset that this story is vastly different from the famous BBC series Sherlock (2010) or the source material. I don't know that it was ever intended to share the same world, only the last name. This isn't Sherlock's story, but Enola's in every way.
Some viewers have their knickers in a twist because of all the historical inaccuracies. Just don't overthink all of it and enjoy the adventure.
It's pretty predictable and doesn't take a lot of risks, other than changing the nature of Sherlock Holmes that we have come to know in other movies.
If you'd like a more historical, dramatic movie of the times, I suggest the movie Suffragette.
Some critics have complained that the movie is a bit too long. I enjoyed every minute, but I admit that there were a couple of times I thought the movie was ending, only to have another scene pick up.""",9
chloesuzette,"""It Could've Been Great if it Wasn't This""",24 September 2020,"""Before anyone attacks me for not being feminist or caring too much about historical accuracy: couldn't care less about those themes in the film. Rather, more that the actors really don't care about their characters (except maybe Brown but she's not convincing in her role), the multiple plotlines they come up with are dull, factors of the plot are never really explained so you don't know if you should feel emotionally invested or not, and the film itself seems to try drag you into an intriguing mystery when all it has is a boring little puzzle with an even more boring and disappointing conclusion.There was so much this movie could do but didn't, or couldn't for whatever reason. The editing is bad (particularly the continuity stuff which is thrown around willy nilly), the 4th wall breaks feel like lazy ways of throwing in exposition and honestly get quite irritating, and overall it just wasn't that interesting. The concept of the Holmes sister can be so widely played with, but sticking her into a trope of ""trying to be herself but also trying to be like Sherlock"" is predictable and just doesn't really work. This character could be so many things but it truly felt like watching a watered down Sherlock mystery you would find in something like Sherlock Gnomes, i.e for children. Just a bit disappointing overall.""",3
t_abdulaziz,"""It had potentials to be better""",25 September 2020,"""I'm not being too serious, but if want to talk about empowering women and feminism with some fun added to it, you shouldn't make it too childish, even if the targeted audience are the young girls.
Waste of potentials!Note: My rating has nothing to do with historical mistakes.""",4

sddb,"""Enjoy the movie""",23 September 2020,"""Ignore the feminism tripe. Sherlock is a bit actor in the movie so don't expect him to be wearing his cape and saving the world. The movie is so pc it's vanished up it's own rear end searching for the light of day. But it is entertaining so sit back poor a drink and neck your natchos.""",7
michelliaghassani,"""Fun to watch, even though a little bit boring""",23 September 2020,"""The movie told us about Enola, Sherlock's sister. She had never been in any school and taught only by her mother, she's smart, diligent, and brave.
One day, her mother was missing and she wanted to find her. While in a way of finding her mother, Enola learning and experiencing the outside world, she also meet a company.The case is actually pretty simple once it's untied. However, the progress to untie and solve the problem that was given is appealing.
The presence of Sherlock and Mycroft are making this movie more interesting to watch.
Moreover, it's a little bit boring at almost the ending. Enola spent a little too much time to solve this and we should watched her getting here and there, while it's just doesn't really necessary.It's an eight for me. It's fun to watch, the problems aren't too heavy yet still leaves a good message that we could simply get.""",8

ketgup83,"""A golden opportunity gone wasted and mowed by weak script""",24 September 2020,"""The trailer of Enola Holmes released by Netflix turned out to be catchy and looked like a fast-paced mystery action drama. However, after watching the movie, it seems Enola Holmes has missed the mark.On her 16th birthday, Enola (spelled ""Alone"" backwards) finds a surprise gift - her only friend in the entire - her mother had left the house. Enola is devastated while situation gets worst when her brothers, Mycroft and Sherlock, comes back to their countryside home and find their little sister in a messed up situation. While Sherlock is casual, Mycroft immediately calls the head mistress of a boarding school and get Enola trained to become an obedient and well-manned lady.Enola finds this decision of Mycroft as forceful and decides to run away from the house. On her journey to search for her mother, Enola finds Marquess, who himself runs away from filthy rich family as they want him to join army like his uncle. However, there has been a hitman hired to kill Marquess which creates curiosity in Enola to solve the case and find out why someone wants Marquess to be dead.Directed by Harry Bradbeer and based on the novel ""The Enola Homes Mystery Book"", Enola Holmes begins on a promising note as the adventure begins right from the train journey where Enola meets Marquess and when Enola involves in getting the case solved while her search for her mother keeps running in parallel. Few action scenes choreographed including the train chase, the fight between Enola and the hitman at the Limehouse, Enola meeting Edith in London are well executed.Unfortunately, Enola Holmes suffers from the half-baked screenplay as the film's pace trends downwards with lot of loopholes. On top of it poor editing towards the second half spoils the mood of the film. There is a scene where Marquess helps Enola escape from the headmistress room in the boarding school which seems so easily done. Sherlock Holmes movies and even web-series boast off some mind-twisting climax. However, the climax scene presented in Enola Holmes was not thrilling at all.Technically, Enola Holmes looks beautiful on screen with 1880's era picture of London is well-depicted thanks to the fantastic art direction, cinematography and good CGI.Enola Holmes belongs to Millie Bobby Brown. Though her expressions are same throughout the film, she carries the film with a good performance and does well in the action scenes. We are so much used to seeing Robert Downey jr and Bennedict Cumberbatch in the Sherlock Holmes roles that it is difficult to digest any other actor. However, Henry Cavill does create a strong impression even though he is not the central character film. The other actor which I liked was Susan Wokoma as Edith and Louis Patridge as Marquess. Helena Bonham Carterm as usual was superb.So, overall, Enola Holmes carried mammoth expectations from its trailer which got salvaged by weak script and poor direction. Watch it if you like a decent period mystery action thriller. Average 2.5/5""",6
gautamshub,"""People are being harsh because of the name Holmes?""",23 September 2020,"""I watched this movie with a easeful mind because I knew from the trailers that it won't be based on Sherlock so it won't be an intense detective storyline. Although Millie did a good job carrying her role. Henry Cavill is always fine suited in whatever he does. Sam Claflin was also good to watch.The movie is a routine detective drama but people are a bit harsh on it because of the name Holmes. Well it could have done the same job without the name too. Most of it was predictable but still it's not a sore flick to watch. It's a bit long, I'll give you that but it's interactive.. well kinda.""",7

The acting is fine, but the storyline wasn't great. The setup to her mom disappearing and Enola going to find her seemed promising, but then it all kind of fell flat for me.
Overall I think this is a fine kids' movie, or a ""play in the background while you chat with friends"" movie.""",3
undeaddt,"""Dissapointing to say the least.""",7 October 2020,"""I expected a lot more when I saw the trailer, it made me feel like there will be mistery, but expressed in a funny sort of way, which was acceptable.

j-hillier1999,"""Millie Bobby Brown shines in a somewhat dull mystery""",27 September 2020,"""Netflix's Enola Holmes started off very promisingly, with its fourth wall breaking heroine really giving it zip, but there wasn't much more after that. The mystery that follows was dull and uninteresting. Every supporting character was annoying and one dimensional.
On the plus side, the script occasionally gives us a laugh but nowhere near enough. It's saved by an electric performance by Millie Bobby Brown whose charisma and fourth wall breaking antics are the only thing that keep your attention.
It wasn't bad. It wasn't great. It was OK.""",6
Bek204,"""""Now, where to begin?""""",27 September 2020,"""Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown) wakes up on her 16th birthday to find out that her mother (Helena Bonham Carter) is missing so she goes on an adventure to find her mother but it leads her to discover herself more.First of all, this movie is not for Sherlock Holmes fans AT ALL, this movie is about a 16 years old girl who is trying to discover herself and choose the path that will lead her to live a happy and satisfying life, it's a sweet, funny, quirky movie made for young teen girls and not for those who are looking for a thrilling, solving a mystery case, Sherlock Holmes level movie.Millie Bobby Brown as Enola Holmes was a perfect choice and she played the role very well exactly how it should be, I mean Millie is an amazing young actress and has a bright future especially after playing Eleven in Stranger Things, Henry Cavill as Sherlock homes was an okay choice but, of course, you can't compare him to Benedict Cumberbatch in the tv series ""Sherlock"", Benedict is the best actor who played the role of Sherlock Holmes, HANDS DOWN. Sam Claflin as Mycroft Holmes was incredible, he was able to give us the role of that mean / annoying old brother perfectly, the whole cast was not a trouble at all, they were all great in their performances.The first half of the film was amazing and I really enjoyed it but the second half was the problem, I felt like the second half of the film was chaos and I got lost and also felt like the movie went far away and was not focusing on the main story which is a thing that I was really annoyed about, felt like the movie was trying to be too many things in once, I got really bored in the second half and couldn't wait for the movie to be over.The set design was so incredible and the movie had some frames that were visually stunning, the camera angles were able to capture the nature around in a perfect way that I really loved, the custom designs were so cool, the different customs of Enola Holmes and suits of Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes were all incredible.Loved how the movie breaks the fourth wall, and how Enola explains some stuff to us in a beautiful way that if you watched the movie you'll get what I mean, that was a great touch in the movie.Enola Holmes is a movie that is not what you expect just because it has the name ""Holmes"" in it, It's not about solving a mystery or surprising the audience, it focuses on the message that is for young teen girls and that's to go after what you want, not care about society and choose the path that you want and not others want for you which is a very sweet message for those young teen girls.

But if you're going to play it safe, at least do it well. The dialogue was corny beyond belief, the acting was awkward and clumsy (probably because of the script) but worst of all, the mystery was unintriguing (probably not a word) and boring. The ciphers pretended to be sophisticated when they are the first thing you think of when you think of a clue. ""The numbers are letters,"" I mean come on. Use some imagination.Overall, it's semi-enjoyable but I wouldn't advise anyone to waste 2 hours. There must be a glitch or a touch of corruption in the Rotten Tomatoes server to give it a 93%.

rdehoop,"""Hardly entertainment value at all""",24 September 2020,"""I was hoping for a great movie, mostly because of the cast, but once again Netflix disappoints with a below average movie. So many things are wrong with this movie. First of all most Sherlock movies focus on a mystery. In this movie there hardly was any mystery at all. The plot was basically about feminism and felt really forced. In a way it reminded me of that terrible new Spike Lee/Netflix movie Da 5 Blood that did the same with 'black live matters'. I am not giving this movie a bad rating because of the feminism though, because I could get past that if there was something else to like about this movie. Funny to see all these feminists on here defending this movie. If you don't like this movie you must be anti feminism..so retarded to think that way. I was just hoping for a nice popcorn movie with fun (familiar) characters, action and some laughs. I got almost none of that. I didn't laugh or smile once. It was just a dull experience with no suspense at all.I wish they would have used the character of Sherlock a little more. Mycroft got a bit more screentime but they are hardly fleshed out characters in this movie. I know it's about Enola, but it seemed like a missed chance to me as they are clearly superior actors. Enola's love interest was overacting in my opinion. His facial expressions just really annoyed me and I had a hard time believing Enola would fall for him at all with his posh accent and his background.Overall I would say that it is an interesting concept but the movie is very lacking in the execution.

For a spinoff of SHERLOCK Holmes, it feels nothing like Sherlock Holmes. For one thing it violates Sherlock Holmes' sacred rule: there is no Sherlock Holmes without Watson. Watson is never seen or mentioned, and Mycroft ironically looks like Watson. Sherlock is barely in it, and does pretty much nothing except care a little for his sister.The film also tries to set up a past conflict within the Holmes family, but it gets no resolution. An effect of this is a very black and white portrayal of Mycroft being an evil misogynist and Sherlock and Enola being saints. And both their apathy or hatred for their mother is never really explained.I feel like the film could have had potential if it separated itself from Sherlock Holmes and filled the gaps with its own story.

SnoopyStyle,"""the charms of MBB""",26 September 2020,"""Enola Holmes (Millie Bobby Brown) grew up with her mother (Helena Bonham Carter) as her teacher and best friend. She doesn't know her late father and her two older absent brothers. One morning, the sixteen year old wakes up to discover her mother has gone missing. Her brothers Sherlock (Henry Cavill) and Mycroft (Sam Claflin) return home. Mycroft is shocked that the house is in disrepair despite his various payments over the years. He insists that Enola attend Miss Harrison's strict finishing school to prepare her for a husband. She runs away to look for her mother. Along the way, she rescues young runaway Lord Tewkesbury (Louis Partridge) from an assassin and uncovers a conspiracy against political reform.Millie Bobby Brown has all the charisma in the world. Cavill is playing Sherlock as a detached loner and Claflin is bordering on villainy. There are two mysteries in the movie but they do not coexist easily. The big mistake is Enola abandoning Tewkesbury in London. It's a much better option for their chemistry to stay together and they create good chemistry later on after they reunite. It makes little sense that he doesn't join her in her search for her mother. It would also make the later encounters with the assassin a lot less awkward. One can always assume that the killer catches up to Tewkesbury. It makes less sense that he catches up to Enola when he had never seen her in a dress. It also makes more sense for Enola to go to Miss Harrison in the beginning rather than in the middle. In the beginning, she can build up her resentment which drives her to runaway. By the middle, she has already shown her independence and her abilities which makes it less likely for her to suffer under Miss Harrison. I watched the trailer after watching the movie and that's exactly what the trailer suggests. I'm not an original thinker. It just seems obvious. There are a few contrivances in the plot. There is also the reason for mother's disappearance. It doesn't get resolved to my satisfaction. It would make more sense if Mycroft already knew that she had siphoned off the money and intends to put her in an institution. The plot throws in so much with the Chinese gunpowder but does not pay it off in the end. The plot needs some better construction. Despite all that, I love MBB's screen presence and can't wait for more from this franchise.""",7

thedailycinegraph,"""Surprisingly good""",26 September 2020,"""'Enola Holmes' is a movie about a teenage girl, a young sister of the famous detective, Sherlock Holmes, and his no less well-known brother, Mycroft. She lived with her mother in a typical British province where both of them lived a life of the dream. They played tennis in a living room, learnt subjects that were atypical for the young lady of those times. There was the whole for each other, and their company was enough for a happy life. However, the week before Enola turned 16, her mother disappeared. So, despite the wish of her brother to send her for the young lady school, the main character decided not only to find her mother but to take responsibility for her own life.To be honest, I started to watch it with scepticism. 'Well, it would be nice to watch the picturesque nature of Britain, see the well-known actors and that's it'. You can't imagine my surprise when I caught myself carefully watching the film. I couldn't take my eyes from all the details - lightness of plot developing, brilliant acting, highly circumspect plot. I can't say that the movie is outstanding, it actually shouldn't be like that. We should remember that it' an adaptation of book series for teens.Bu the way, this fact influenced the movie significantly. Several topics were mentioned in the movie that are still difficult to discuss even for adults. They are feminism. generation gap, the influence and pressure from family members and society, the inevitability of circumstances, the issues of raising children. But it popped up so easily, without any judgment. Just like ""issues to consider in future"".On a separate point, I would like to mention the acting both of movie giants (Helena Bonham Carter, Fiona Shaw, Frances de la Tour, Henry Cavill, Sam Claflin) and young beginners (Millie Bobby Brown and Louis Patridge). They had no even a sec of falsity or histrionics, only high0level acting that draws the audience attention.To sum up, it's a witty, light and kind movie for you to watch with your closest and dearest""",6
radoslawjakubiak,"""A beautifully disguised Mary Sue""",26 September 2020,"""TLDR: While it does a pretty good job at pretending it just a well-made teen action movie, it is a political statement. I gave it 5 stars because of great production value and good cast. It is all form and no substance, which is a shame - it could have been a lot more.In short, Enola is a little Wonderwoman/Ray. 16 years old, never outside of her home, ""trained"" by her loony mother, no formal education whatsoever. With no real life experience she manages to do great in London (which was a vicious place at the time). As a superhuman being that pretty much all of modern female characters seem to be, she is perfect from the start, makes no mistakes and does not need to grow or learn. First ever real fight, against an experienced hired killer no less? She not only outwits him (which could make sense since he might have underestimated her coginitive abilities - a teen is still a child you know), but also manages to fight him off in hand-to-hand combat and ultimately kills him. Not only is this completely unrealistic, but since the movie is so set on ""empowerment"" and ""girl power"", it gives young girls a bad and in all honesty very dangerous idea: that they can stand their ground against an older, experienced, way stronger and male opponent. It is simply not the case, no matter how many hours you've clocked on your martial arts classes. It simply does not work that way, period.What Will You Learn Whilst Watching Enola:1. Terrorism is fine if you do it for the right reasons. Bombing public spaces and possibly killing innocent people for the sake of feminist ""progress""? Totally fine.2. Being average is bad, you always need to ""find your own way"". Apparently finding a good husband and having a nice life is an appalling idea.3. Order is bad, everybody should just do whatever they want and it will all be fine4. ""Secret"" female-only martial arts classes led by a black woman (that is very black-panthery by the way, but who cares) were a thing apparently. Also, how could they be kept a secret if they organised them on the floor just above a posh pattiserie/cafe? It was extremely noisy and even made the lamp swing wildly. Wouldn't such establishments be frequented by high ranking policemen, politicians and the like? Would nobody notice? Actually, now that I think of it: who would willingly go there if they had to suffer the constant noise while eating their cake and drinking coffee? Wouldn't you go to a quieter place?5. Enola is smarter than Sherlock, despite having no experience in basically anything6. Scotland Yard police officers were idiots7. Corsets can protect you against stabbing!8. A young and attractive girl could just wander around back alleys of Victorian London and nobody would ever bother her9. Want to avoid raising suspicion? Dress up as a widow. Apparently nobody would remember a 16-year old attractive girl already being a widow.10. Training, discipline and learing from your mistakes are for losers.11. All men are incompetent, blundering fools that have no idea what they are doing.Also, at the end of the movie, Enola's mother congratulates her as if it was her that made the new progressive bill pass. But she didn't do anything - it was the people she never even met (men by the way!) voting that did the job. Why did she just accept praise for something she didn't do? What kind of example does that set?""",5

oyuncuayan,"""Does anyone know who is Sherlock Holmes?""",26 September 2020,"""Sherlock Holmes name is a kind of noble name. Everyone can't be Sherlock Holmes. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle did a great job once. He was English and he could imagine who is Sherlock. He created the Sherlock Holmes in his head and he was inspired by one of his doctors. Arthur Conan Doyle knew who is Sherlock. Who doesn't know; Nancy Springer. (Harry Bradbeer too) They created the guy named Sherlock Holmes -the only similarity between the real Sherlock is the names- and they just left it. There are billions of mistakes in the Enola Holmes movie and the books. Sherlock doesn't feel emotions. SHERLOCK DOESN'T FEEL EMOTIONS! It's one of the mistakes. But the movie without Holmes last name is ""okay"". Millie Bobby is a great actress.""",4
endercattm,"""It was okay""",26 September 2020,"""First of all, can people please stop being so condescending to people who don't like this movie? Everyone has their own tastes, maybe it has nothing to do with the feminist message (I'm not saying people won't dislike it for said message, but not everyone is like that). Same goes for people who are against it because of the message: it was fine, but there were still issues.It was a cutsey little movie, I guess. The characters were bland, except for Enola. The fourth wall breaks were not something I enjoyed a lot: in fact, I found it unnerving, but that's just me. Maybe inner dialogue would've been better. I guess if the book is in first person, it's hard to translate it onto the screen.
And arriving at the message: it could've been better done. It was good sometimes while most of the time it was forced and cringy. Comments like ""useless boy"" and ""useless men"" made me uncomfortable, as the goal is not the belittle men but to uplift women. It drives a point that women don't need no man but it could've been done better. I do think that it's important to teach girls that they should make their own decisions and that no one, not even their own family, should decide for them. That they can do whatever they want and they should be allowed to. But the way Hollywood goes about it isn't very nuanced or good at all: making overpowered, perfect characters that just so happen to be female, therefore girls should ""relate"" to them is absurd.Also, are we not going to talk about how the mother and that one token black lady were going to commit terrorism? And no one touched on it or said ""terrorism bad""? The mom recognized it was bad so why wasn't it spoken more clearly?
Lastly, the ""love interest"" and Enola had no chemistry whatsoever. It felt very forced, probably because it was like they barely knew each other. They had 4-5 encounters total in the movie and you suspect me to think they like each other? Maybe it's the actors, I dunno, but no chemistry.Overall, it was okay and enjoyable but too long and wasn't that great in the end. I won't be watching it again. The plot twist, however, was very well done.""",4

It has a very cliched story of someone who's on their path of self discovery, who ends up falling in love and the end. It might be probably cuz of the Sherlock series' and movies' influence on me but it's just pretty decent. Don't expect it to be a big mystery movie. I liked the actors playing their parts and even the cinematography for it gives us a visual treat but the story kind of lagged.
I'm a Henry Cavill fan and I think he just did a decent job as Sherlock even when I know that his acting is kind of limited. The other guy who plays Mycroft in the film also does a decent job. The main lead gave a decent performance but the story fell flat. It's probably because of the influence I have through SH movies & series. This is a one time watch movie with not so memorable moments/performances. I'm curious to see Henry in a full fledged Sherlock role maybe in a spin off.

The movie is annoyingly aware of itself -- the main actress is always looking straight into the camera, winking and smirking and talking to the audience like we're part of the action -- but not good enough to pull it off. The movie wants to have its cake and eat it too. Enola is a feminist role model for young girls yet the movie still seems to find a way to stick her tomboy character in a restrictive Victorian gown so that she can look pretty. It's ok, you see, because she CHOOSES to wear the dress as part of a disguise. She then proceeds to do martial arts while wearing the dress, which pretty much negates every point the movie made up to that point in time about how corsets were just one convention society engineered to keep women contained in their place.Young girls might like this movie.

Cineanalyst,"""Sherlock Jr.""",24 September 2020,"""I didn't know Eleven and Superman were siblings... but, it makes sense.Based on derivative young adult fiction from Nancy Springer, as opposed to Arthur Conan Doyle's original tales of Sherlock Holmes, the game that is afoot in ""Enola Holmes"" is of a different sort than that of detective fiction--at least of the good kind. Although, nominally, there are mysteries (where's the mother? how is the boy's life in danger?), their solutions are far too easy for anyone other than, perhaps, the kiddie readers originally intended for the text. The machinations of the story are simple--even hackneyed. One walk in the woods, as Sherlock's teenage sister, Enola, has only begun her second investigation, and an experienced viewer will already know what the twist will be. Indeed, it's elementary. To cite a more recent example; it's no ""Knives Out"" (2019). That's not the point, though, or at least it's not the main appeal of this movie.A good mystery is about plot, principally. One manifestation of this in the Holmes stories is the surrogate author within the story, a.k.a. the stupid friend, Watson. But, ""Enola Holmes"" is about character and place, including the entire dynamic of patriarchy versus women's suffrage. In this regard, it's delightful--a fish-out-of-water tale like ""Wonder Woman"" (2017), of an exceptional young woman entering London society to track down Ares (or her mother in this case) and being distracted by a young man in the process. Or, even more to the point, of Eleven from ""Stranger Things"" in search of her mother, but who is distracted by boys along the way. It's not only Doyle's more ""emotional"" Holmes, as the series became more about its popular character, that's being ripped off here--I mean, serving pastiche. The meta-narrative device employed here, too, is the titular, fourth-wall-breaking narrator talking directly to and sometimes winking at the audience in the vein of, say, ""Deadpool"" (2016), but more juvenile, or, depending on how you look at it, less juvenile. Enola invites us on an adventure of discovery of her place in this world of detective fiction, and if this does become a franchise, now that we have Superman instead of Iron Man and Doctor Strange, too, maybe we'll get a real mystery next time. At least, for now, Millie Bobby Brown is fun to follow around, including an exciting train sequence and action-movie fight scenes, and the supporting cast features some hefty talents in Henry Cavill and Helena Bonham Carter to assist in the lighthearted, if lightweight, affair.""",6

I mean from the books you get the idea given the context and the facts, but it's subtle and you still get the idea. Also some of the changes that were made for it are the same that repulsed some of the people in the comment section. And some of the things are a bit annoying for a period movie.
Also, as someone else said in the comments: Henry Cavill looks like a Superman in a suit instead of Sherlock Holmes.All in all, don't let all the 1* reviews push you away from it.

But there is much more that could have been done with this, and an actress with Millie's chops could have easily met far greater challenges in this role.In short, where the movie should have been impressive it was droll, where it should have been brilliant it was only moderately interesting, and thus my ""mediocre"" 5-star rating. I might have given it one more star if not for the pointless narrative ho-hum ending (which I will not spoil here. Suffice to say it was a yawner). I was looking forward to this film.

We all know about his older brother Mycroft, the politician who likes to keep status in government untarnished. But it seems noone really knew of a sister, Enola which as Millie Bobby Brown points out in Netflix's Enola Holmes it spells alone backwards. And it seems like this could be the start of a franchise in waiting, if it was to succeed, in that case since its on Netflix that has to be up to the audience numbers. That may or not be difficult thanks to Brown's effervescent attitude towards the character, the 16 year-old English actress gives a brilliant performance bringing her character life in fact for effort it's an 11. But for everything else it seems that there could've been a lot more lighter in the story though thanks to Brown and Henry Cavill's more suave take on Sherlock Holmes and it's definitely a lighter tone than both of Guy Ritchie's takes. Director Harry Bradbeer makes this world enchanting to disappear into and in Enola, Brown seems to have found her crowning glory. Granted it succeeds in the embodiment of female power but lacks in its subtlety, thankfully other than that Enola Holmes and Brown offer a fine and fun adventure that needs more work done to it maybe if it does become a franchise, it can improve its standards along the way.

The writers were trying to make him more a villain than 2nd supporting role.Henry Cavill's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes was ok, but he did not really put much work into it, he did not research the character and that is why it was not perfect.But in his defence this story is by another author not by Conan Doyle and Henry Cavill was just doing his job maybe he just wasn't directed right.They also fail to tell us the timeline of the film. It shows a flashback of Enola being born and says 1884 in writing, but there is an automobile in the film and Enola is 16 so the year must be 1900?They also mentioned a few times Holmes always works alone and Watson is not referenced at all.If it was set in 1884 that means Holmes has known Watson for three years because they met in 1881 in 'A Study in Scarlet' but if it was set in 1900 that means Holmes has known Watson for 19 years and it's also been 5 years since he faked his death.It was disrespectful what they did with the illustrations by making fun of them and doing a childish sketch, they should respect Sidney Pagets' work.Millie Bobby Brown did well as Enola Holmes and was a strong female lead but there were few scenes cut to next where she seem to not be focusing on here acting and from some of the behind the scenes footage I've seen she was very childish on set, in good way which is great to have fun with your co stars but it's still good to be professional.Sam Claflin was the same apparently but Henry Cavill was always focused on his acting straight away when they said action and the cameras starting rolling.Burn Gorman was a great villain I thought he might of been Professor Moriarty before the trailer hit.The trouble these days is they get the most famous actors to play the roles it's very much like what Christopher Nolan said in a documentary about 'The Dark Knight Trilogy' he didn't wanna get the most famous actors he wanted to get the best actors.This is what you gonna do with Sherlock Holmes, don't get the most famous get the best actors to play the roles.""",5

Enola is almost a Mary Sue, but with just enough flaws and failures to not be. What starts with a great intrigue about her mother and puzzles disappears and never really revisits. No real complex solve, just a very obvious 'who stands to gain the most' crime. The role of Sherlock and his Sister was what I felt worked best. I just never really felt anything for any of these people. Something was missing, maybe it was the sparodic 'down with the patriarchy' message which were jettisoned in for reasons.

Her background was a bit hastily thrown at us but was adequate I think. I understand the climate of today's vision for woman, however it may have been pushed a bit far to suite the period this film was portraying. It wasn't quite to the point of being a distraction, but close.
Granted the story wasn't about ""Sherlock"", but it may have pulled on the coattails of his lineage more than some would care for by nearly rendering his involvement in this film rather inert which will undoubtedly frustrate true Sherlock Holmes fans.

lasttimeisaw,"""Film Review - Enola Holmes (2020) 6.2/10""",7 October 2020,"""A retcon of the proverbial universe of Sherlock Holmes, ENOLA HOLMES pushes his much younger sister in the forefront, and pertinently asserts a modern feminist manifesto in the person of our 16-year-old heroine.Enola (Brown), ""alone"" spells backwards, is raised by her mother Eudoria (Carter), after the latter vanishes into thin air on the day of her 16th birthday, Enola, for the first time, embarks on a quest on her own, to seek out the truth. Whilst, her two more world-savvier elder brothers Mycroft and Sherlock Holmes (Claflin and Cavill, both presumably on board for a fat check other than any artistic ambition, since their contrasted acting chops, one goes hyperbolic and the other opts for low-key condescension, are so awfully inconsequential) are not entirely helpful in that aspect, the former persists in dragging her to a finishing school run by Miss Harrison (Shaw, a marvelous harridan), whereas the latter uncharacteristically seesaws about whether or not he should be emotionally invested in his sister's growing pains.Enola is a remarkable young woman, mostly courtesy to Eudoria's unconventional methods of upbringing, she is fostered and trained to be intelligent, erudite, independent and martial arts-savvy (a throw-down with Susie Wokoma's Edith signifies that she still has a long way to go in refining her skills, but the token inclusion of Wokoma feels short-changed, that is a black woman who can give Sherlock a piece of her mind!), all the qualifies to be standing out from the crowd. Yet, introducing a new detective in the renowned family, ENOLA HOLMES is not much fun in solving the puzzles, Enola's mission is waylaid after she saves the young Viscount Tewkesbury, Marquess of Basilwether (Patridge, trapped in a gender-reversed damsel-in-distress role but his fresh-faced earnestness is quite a catch) from being dispatched by a merciless bowler-wearing killer Linthorn (Gorman). Some physical violence might be too squeamish for audience who are attuned to chick-lit flicks (Enola must take some hiding to toughen up), but the ultimate trigger-puller is expectedly the least we should expect, and Enola is none the wiser in deciphering that. Also, the story half-asses about Eudoria's mysterious disappearance, coded message-sending aside, no real deduction or intrigue is required here.Indefatigably maneuvering the fourth-wall-breaking gimmick à la the hit TV series FLEABAG, with which the film shares the same director Harry Bradbeer, ENOLA HOLMES, for what it is worth, purveys the young Millie Bobby Brown (who is also one of the producers of the movie) a period stage (pleasingly digitalized, though looking shoddy when the action accelerates) to show the potentiality of broadening her (already massive) demography of audience, and she makes a good fist of it, a pert role model of her age, her Enola is an inspiration feels authentic, merely due to the actor's exuberance and alacrity (not that the script offers her any justice), it is a new IP for her to rest on in a long run, provided that some ingenious work from scenarists can be secured in its inevitable sequels.""",6

The movie tries to keep the dynamics and atmosphere of the famous Sherlock Holmes movies with Robert Downey Jr. Though Millie Bobby Brown showed that she is quite the actress and that she can do more than Stranger Things, the movie and the plot doesn't live up to her acting.The movie is about solving cases and it doesn't let us, the audience, enough time to decipher the clues when Enola Holmes is often breaking the fourth wall by addressing directly to the audience. Instead, they quickly explain the codes when other scenes progress really slowly.Also, the main plot happens around the extension of voting for women in 1884. The movie leaves quite some clues but not enough to be sure of what it is about. You are left with these wandering thoughts: ""What is going on? Why do they want to kill the viscount?""

Other major players were either poorly cast or poorly scripted.Having read the entire Sherlock Holmes oeuvre,Henry Cavill was miscast as Sherlock. His older brother Mycroft, who in the original stories was considered ""Sherlock's smarter brother"", is scripted as a not very bright martinet. In the original stories, Sherlock occasionally goes to Mycroft when badly puzzled. These two poorly done characters cast a pall on the movie.Similarly, the character of Adeel Akhtar as Lestrade was poorly written. Although the original Lestrade was competitive with Sherlock, he also consulted with him frequently and was a serious Scotland Yard detective, not a somewhat frenetic boob as in this movie.If you have read the original Sherlock Holmes books, you will be disappointed by these characterizations. Nevertheless, Millie Bobby Brown is a treat worth watching.""",6

Generally, the movie was good, art direction, Cinematography, lighting and casting were goof but yet what's the purpose.
After 90 minutes enola changes her goal to save the LORD she met on her way, and yet she didn't find her mother, her mother found her. Enola solves a case that wasn't really important for the theme of the movie even though they won the votes by ONE VOTE, really?
Sam claffin was great as always, he did his role perfectly, as well as all the secondary stars of the movie.
But when you choose someone to play your main role in the movie, to start a sequel i believe, you don't choose someone who only appeared in 9 movies and 1 series. Just imagine Hailey stainfield in that role.

However, there are some glaring problems with Enola Holmes that prevented me from enjoying it more.As I remember, Mycroft Holmes has always been portrayed as Sherlocks cynical brother but always one that has the welfare of the Holmes' at heart. In Enola Holmes, Sam Claflin portrays Mycroft (through no fault of his own I may add) as essentially the antagonist of the film, completely overshadowing Frances De La Tour as the real antagonist. There are no likeable character traits to get behind or make you feel as if Mycroft is there as anything other than a generally unsavoury individual. I've not read the Enola Holmes books so I can't say whether this is as a result of the source material, but treating the character like this affords him very little justice.I don't understand the necessity of this film to begin with, or what it's target audience is supposed to be. Any real sense of mystery and intrigue is lacking. The supporting cast feel like exactly that; aside from Sherlock, characters such as Tewkesbury, Mycroft and the Dowager are not allowed any real screen time to develop or get behind as this is all about displaying Millie Bobby Brown's capabilities as an up and coming actress.

When her mother vanishes suddenly overnight, Enola follows a series of clues to investigate her mother's life, whilst avoiding her pursuing brothers and rescuing young Marquis Tewksbury (Louis Partridge) from an assassin.I almost really loved ""Enola Holmes"". It gets so much right. The casting is perfect. Henry Cavill and Sam Claflin play Sherlock and Mycroft respectively. I understand that some have been upset about this version of Sherlock being nicer than other portrayals but honestly, you have to have different performances of a character, or what's the point in doing it? In this all they do is make him relatively nicer than Mycroft, but he's not emasculated or weakened in anyway. There's a supporting cast of decent faces from UK television, Burn Gorman, Adeel Akhtar, Susan Wokoma, David Bamber, Frances de la Tour, Claire Rushbrook and Fiona Shaw all bringing something to their characters. Louis Partridge, who has the character most likely to be insufferably annoying manages to find the right balance - keeping his character posh but not stuckup, unworldly but not dumb - it's well done. The world building is good too, a solid Victorian London and several stately homes. I liked that Brown is narrating the film straight into camera too. It's far from a new idea, but it's fun here and she's engaging and charming doing it.The flaw is the specific story. Essentially it's two cases, her missing mother is one - but then focus shifts to the assassination attempt of the young lord and who is behind that. Neither of which is particularly clever and both of which are a little anticlimactic.Give me a sequel, with a new case and less of the introduction stuff to deal with and I'll be all over it.

Every single movie has a major demographic and this imo should have been a very diverse movie and falls short in its genre which is why I think this has equal amounts of good and bad reviews.The movie as a whole was good but also very mediocre. The plot was basic and some scenes were very cheesy and cliche but not in a good way. This movie tries to push a meaning of a young girl finding out who she is and gaining strength along the way (so pretty much a coming of age). But unlike most coming of ages that are funny, genuine and somewhat realistic. This isn't relatable at all. Its too cheesy and cliche that it becomes so odd because its trying to push a serious idea but made in such a crap goofy way that tries way too hard to appeal to everyone and ends up appealing to no one.The acting was only okay because the scenes were all pretty cheesy so not much can be expected. The characters were interesting and wholesome enough. The cast is pretty great filled with A-listers and is actually a very redeeming factor for this film.The old timey nature of this film is also pretty cool to see and I appreciated the sherlock Holmes aspect. The end of this film was very typical and cheesy which sucked but it wasn't too bad.Overall I would only suggest this movie if your bored as hell and if you have Netflix.

TheVictoriousV,"""For what it is, it's not bad. But it is indeed what it is.""",28 September 2020,"""Enola Holmes is the latest addition to the progressive vogue of revising an established fictional universe in such a way that ""actually, this Strong Female Character^tm was the most powerful, intelligent, and important being around this whole time"" - and yes, one could easily craft a female role model this formidable (struggles and humanizing traits optional) in a wholly original work, but it's easier to cash in on people's progressive values/feminism if you also have brand recognition and nostalgia. For what it is, it's not bad. But it is indeed what it is.In this case, the universe being tampered with is that of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, and to be fair, since Detective Holmes has already been adapted in all sorts of cringey ways throughout the past century, a fan-fic like this is far from the worst. I've read there even exists an Enola Holmes book series so you can't really chalk this one up to big, bad PC culture (in its modern form, anyhow).Millie Bobby Brown is nevertheless likable as Enola Holmes, sister of Sherlock, played here by Henry Cavill (who I find is at his best when not having to fake an American accent). The synopsis promises that, contrary to what we know of Sherlock and his status as the greatest detective of them all, Enola shall find ways to outsmart him.On top of Brown (often glancing at the camera à la Fleabag) and the empowerment delivered both by her and other characters with marginalized backgrounds (including Susan Wokama's character, who sneers at the privileged complacency of those who don't care about politics), the biggest draw of Enola Holmes seems to be newcomer Louis Partridge. That is, among the YA crowd.These types are nowadays found on Twitter, sharing interchangeable ""thirsty for Patridge"" memes that make me wonder if they're actual human beings (albeit programmed during youth into unconditional fandom and consumption) as opposed to publicity-drumming plants. If Twitter was as ubiquitous during the heyday of Twilight, you bet we would've seen something similar with low-res ""Team Edward"" images.Also to be drooled over is Sam Claflin as Mycroft, and the Holmes family matriarch is played by Helena Bonham Carter so I won't act like I'm much better than the average Netflix-stan Twitter account. That's me being humble.Despite its political themes, some of which are relevant to still ongoing struggles, I'd say the film works as a fun crime-solving romp. Young girls who watch it will feel empowered by the prospect that they, too, can be extraordinary detectives, but I don't think this will drag them into bigger conversations that may confuse them at their age (as might otherwise be the case when films for younger viewers aren't entirely subtle with these things, and I sincerely hope more radical parents don't try convincing them that wanting to join the Holmes family is equivalent to wanting a police job). They'll have fun watching it and then, as observed, share memes of the cute boys in it. Enjoy it while it lasts.For the older viewers, there are charming call-backs to the Doyle novels. These viewers will no doubt have questions, like I initially did, as to why we need to do fanfiction to inspire the kiddies instead of doing something new and fresh and leaving Doyle be.However, I don't think this plays as bitterly or resentfully as, say, The Predator and Ghostbusters 2016. It adds something cool to a fictional universe I was tired of anyway. My Sherlock is still the mouse, though.""",6
ivo_shandor,"""Could be better as a series""",28 September 2020,"""Enola Holmes is a fine thing to twiddle away the afternoon for on Netflix. Great music, production, and cast, but it needs to be toned way down in some areas, and made clearer story-wise in others. All the shuffle of a grander scheme feels pushed to the side, and lends itself to predictability and annoying character choices at times. While grating, it has a quirky demeanor and charm that could make a series better for it, rather than just a one-off movie. I'd rather see Enola take on more traditional mysteries than one's with a preachy message. There's a reason the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew are still remembered, because mysteries like those draw the attention of those young at heart, and those who wish for a simpler plot. It's harmless enough and has it's little quirks, but with a tighter, cleverer script it could be a little more satisfying. I would be curious to see more, as long as it takes a step back and finds it's niche in the simple and quirky rather than a preachy annoyance. It's right in the middle, and you can't progress if you aim for the middle. With some more time and tweaking, it could be a fun little series.""",5

Which is tiresome.But the true impediment to greatness will be its innaccuracies. Sherlock fans are rabid and dedicated. They will notice and take offense when the characters do things like TALK in the Diogenes club or say Mycroft is jealous for being the stupid one, which is honestly so bizarre, it does not compute. They'll also notice she can't deduce like Sherlock (she's definitely smart, but can make obvious logical conclusions and solve word puzzles at best) and largely blunders into answers.The historical innaccuracies are also very annoying. The jiu-jitsu class is fine, but she runs around offering poor people the modern equivalent of $800+ usd to swap clothes with her, instead of, you know, buying them for significantly less from a store. With her hair down, which only hookers or crazy people did. And includes the obligatory ""corsets bad!"" commentary, which made my eye twitch.Overall, I'm going to say this would be a good film for pre tweens to early teens who aren't super Sherlock fans, but in the mood for a ""I am finding myself, hear me roar"" bit of character development in their Netflix pick.Adult history or Sherlock buffs who get nitpicky about details will go spare and should skip it for the sake of the little vein in their forehead.Why a parent may want to preview it: for a small section, they strongly imply that domestic terrorism bombings are a viable tool for social and political activism, though more peaceful, cerebral methods win the day and no political bombings take place. Your younger kid may not notice it, but it is there.""",6
matej-trkanjec-133-920386,"""Under 15 - a great flick, over 15 - o boy.""",28 September 2020,"""As the Enola Holmes flick hit Netflix, I was just as excited as the next person seeing Brown in the lead role, as well as Cavil as Sherlock and a handful of other famous actors in prominent roles. The very concept is intriguing, fun and in most part - entertaining. However, it lacks certain elements that will make it a really interesting and memorable September flick, potentially spawning numerous sequels.1) The plot. There seems to be a bit of a hard cut in this department as the movie actually follows one quite interesting plot point up until half of the movie. For some, to me unexplained reason, this plot was entirely abandoned and another was commenced entirely. The two plot points were intended to be connected, as the ending of the movie insinuates, but the way they are told is completely unprofessional and I am not sure as to what exactly happened here. The first plot - finding mother - is abandoned almost at the peak of its depiction, indicating that something sinister is at hand. The other - finding the lost marquess - is dull and uninteresting up until the very ending of the movie that reveals why exactly he was being hunted. The two plots were supposed to co-exists and bring up an unified ending, but the movie never does that. It simply abandons the first one leaving the viewers with a final rushed scene trying to explain what happened with her mother, but it doesn't really do that at all. It is up to the imagination of the viewer as to what was going on, and an average viewer over the age of 15 will have no trouble concluding a quite sinister and frankly, disturbing plot. It is a shame that this was not explored more as this would have been a much more interesting movie in the end. Secondly, the very underlining theme of female emancipation is extremely vivid even though the movie never really states what the crucial segments are - the suffragettes, the right for women to vote and so on and so on. But the implications are all over the place, leaving one to wonder why these crucial segments were not explored more openly. Henceforth, a movie that starts quite interestingly dissolves into a young adult teen fiction that will not satisfy anyone over the age of 15 (but with today's standards I will sooner go with 13).2) The acting. The hypnotising acting abilities of Brown are the sole selling point of this movie, and they are rightfully so. Her range of emotions and depiction of them is staggering. Her ability to convey almost exactly what she is feeling and how she handles much greater professionals then herself is phenomenal. The ""breaking the fourth wall"" scenes are by far the most entertaining as you can actually see how much fun she is having playing the title character and how she actually dug deep into the complexities of what and who she is playing. Her career is in an upright spiral and I do believe it do go even higher. Cavil on the other hand was... dull. It is almost a joy to see him play Sherlock but there is a fundamental problem with his portrayal - he didn't play Sherlock... I am not aware as to who he played, but that was not Sherlock. Just one look as to his approach is enough for a casual viewer to determine that he is a bit lost within the character and goes for the silent type, but I detect a bit of constraint to his portrayal. I am not sure however, if that is to be the screenplay and direction or his lack of understanding of the character. Given his latter work, I am inclined to think that it is the screenplay and direction. Claflin, however, did a spectacular job portraying the period piece ""gentleman"" that thinks women are baby machines and kitchen material. His portrayal is frenetic and intense at all times, but, the same as Cavil, his portrayal differs greatly from the original material. If he is to be a representation of that time's male (and n some cases female) mentality, then it is a job well done. Also, when confronted with Brown, it is quite visible that they are a perfect character match portraying different mentalities and standpoints. Also, it is an incredible shame that this segment was not explored in more detail.3) The directing/editing. The movie was edited quite nicely up to about half of its duration. Up from there, as stated above, the editing becomes more and more in the service of prolonging a movie in the worst way possible. The two interwoven story-lines should have intercepted sooner and should have been told simultaneously, climaxing as they come to a full crossing. This was not, however the case, and it is only to the blame of the director for not creating this intriguing and generally, often used method.All in all, this is really a young adult movie through and through. It is engaging for the most part, interesting at points and generally entertaining. It deals with important and difficult issues but never fully addresses them. It uses interesting techniques that it does not fully develop and starts plot points that it does not finish in a satisfactory manner. However, despite these notions, this is a full rounded and finished movie. It is just a shame it was not a bit more rounded and straightforward. In the end, anyone older than 15 will have a problem with it as it will serve for a rainy Sunday afternoon if and only if, nothing else is available.""",6
patrick000000111,"""Not bad, not good either""",28 September 2020,"""The feminism is not as bad as people are saying. The values that are trying to be represented are fine, but its pointed out a bit too much. I would prefer if it is more subtle, you don't have to constantly remind your audience of your hidden message. That kind of is the opposite of what the point of a hidden message is.Anyways, the actors are great and fun to watch, which was to be expected, but the script they were given is quite often cringy, especially a few of Enola's lines at the start. Henry Cavill sadly seems miscast, especially if you have seen cumberbatch's Sherlock. I cannot quite put my finger on the exact reason, maybe his script makes him to nice, maybe he just looks ""too handsome""? This is obviously not his fault, but I feel like the character is supposed to be a bit more quirky.One other deal breaker for me is that there are a bit too many historical inaccuracies. Its in general not that much of an issue when its concerns minor details, but the inaccuracies seem to be forced in order to create more diversity. It in no way serves the plot at all, which is a shame.
After the first half an hour or so it gets pretty fun, but I think this movie is best watched by kids/teens.""",6

SB100,"""Lots of action""",27 September 2020,"""I would call myself something of a Sherlockian but was not offended by this definitely non-canonical film wherein Sherlock's younger sister shows that she is also possessed of detective skills. And she shows other skills which her brother also has, being very good in a fight. The plotline, revolving around a young lord and a fictitious reform bill, and Enola's revolutionary mother, is as thin as paper, and also contains a lot of holes.
But no matter, our heroine is always dashing somewhere to find something. Most men come off badly, although there is a spark of sympathy between Enola and Sherlock. Some reviewers here have complained about feminism being shoved down the viewer's throat, but this period between 1890 and 1914 was very much the first wave of feminism and Enola's mother is not a particularly unlikely figure in her attitudes.
I found the lead actress hard to hear at times. Henry Carvill was by no means the worst Holmes I have seen.""",6

Bello-4,"""Typical YA Movie Save For A Well Known Name...""",27 September 2020,"""While so far as YA movies for television go Enola Holmes (based on a YA book) is an enjoyable film, it would've made an even more enjoyable series. The movie does tell a good story, you can appreciate that Enola is smart and kind of scrappy as opposed to being a well to do girl bumbling through life. Also attention was paid to the time period. What sets this movie apart however is the famous name attached to it, Millie Bobby Brown, which is why anyone cares about this movie and probably why Netflix is even bothering with it. In a world where Sherlock Holmes existed and had a larger family including a brother and a kid sister, the events of Enola Holmes unfold beginning with the disappearance of the Holmes matriarch which doesn't seem to upset either of the two Holmes brothers very much surprisingly. In typical YA fashion things unfold too effortlessly for young Enola and interestingly her primary mystery, that of what has happened to her mother, falls by the way side as she side tracks to help a boy of similar age the mystery surrounding her mother coming back ultimately with an all too neat bow wrapping itself up at the end. I'm sure police departments around the world would appreciate mysteries that just wound themselves up.I had thought that Enola Holmes was a series that Brown had filmed in the off season from Stranger Things and not a singular movie. Truth be know it would've been better as a series allowing for development of all the characters involved which was sorely needed, as well as a more suspenseful mystery with subplots (reference the aforementioned side track and neatly wrapped ending).If you don't mind reaching back in time a little and you can find it, try the series The Adventures of Shirley Holmes from the late 1990's featuring the great grand neice of Sherlock Holmes.""",6
mr_sharma,"""It could have been so much better""",26 September 2020,"""There are plenty of Holmes' yarns about.One set in modern times. One where he gets old. Comedies. Gritty. Light hearted. And now this. The twist is that The Holmes' brothers have a younger sister.She's 16ish and therefore the appeal is to the modern viewer.There are a number of issues with this film.Primarily, it's to do with the script.The pacing is off. It plods. That stems from it being overlong (over 2 hours).I understand value for money but there isn't anything amazing on display to warrant the extra minutes.It's trying to be a forward thinking, historical, detective story wrapped up in a 39 steps type plot. It alludes to reform and past historical ""threats"" But never really explains them.You would think with Bobbi-brown (spelling?) in the lead, with stranger things in her arsenal of work, that it would be more engaging....and more so when you have Cavil and Caflin in support.....but Millie is not really someone who can carry this on her own. Her regular breaking of the 4th wall starts to feel laboured and trying. It get it rating rather than being funny, mused or cute.Cavil is a sideshow really with his Sherlock (definitely see BOND written all over his future) and Caflin plays it up an over bearing brother (his character reminded me of that horrible character he played in Nightingale). Too 1 dimensional. Which, frankly, could be said of all the characters in this film.Helena Bonham-Carter is the best thing in this but she hardly appears other than occasional flashbacks.There are a little too many coincidences to make it palatable.The saving grace, from the lack of pace, is the ending. That, though, feels like the film it should have been. More harder edged, action packed and unexpected (although there are a lot of logic leaps and coincidences for my liking to get us there).Ultimately, we watched it as a family and my 16 year old daughter liked it, my youngest was ok about it and us two adults thought it was pretty forgettable.It really could have been so much better.""",6

theredsky,"""Enola Holmes Review""",26 September 2020,"""Some what entertaining but mostly bland and predictable. Millie Bobbie Brown is a very talented actress and I'm excited to see where her career goes from here and she is easily the best part of this film. She brings a lot of energy to the role and while her 4th wall breaking and script she is given may not be good, she's still trying. Henry Cavill also does a pretty good job here too and I wish we got to see more of his take on Sherlock Holmes. The film is well shot but it doesn't do anything creative with its shots and the production design, costume design, and score are all pretty good. Everything else however was definitely below average. The plot is fast which is nice but certain elements of the story are not engaging at points. The setups and pay offs are so predictable that you could see them coming from a mile away. The editing is very dull and rapid and there are some very obvious green screen moments here and there. I took a lot of issue with the 4th wall breaks. It felt out of place and awkward at many points and really ground the film to a halt when it happened. I know they need to explain some elements but it could have been done much better than that. Go check this out on Netflix if you are a fan of Millie Bobbie Brown or Henry Cavill or if you enjoy the universe of Sherlock Holmes. If you don't like any of those elements, then you can definitely pass on this.""",6
Akwel,"""Ferris Bueller Holmes""",26 September 2020,"""I can't help but think about Matthew Broderick when a person of high school age does this much fourth-wall breaking in a movie. Millie does an alright job filling in those shoes, I just feel like the writing sometimes is a bit lackluster because it tries to be so many things at once. For example I found myself wanting more badassery from a 16 year old that have been trained in martial arts for so long but the comedy came in the way of that.(and the clichéd one move that she couldn't figure out until the end was so unnecessary.) Also I found myself wanting more depth in any of the relationships she had, i.e. with Sherlock, Mycroft or the Vicount, but the detective story came in the way of that. For a runtime of 123 minutes I felt little was accomplished or earned and everything just kind of fell into place out of nowhere in the end.""",6

However, here they show Sherlock to be much more warm and caring. It was definitely nice to see this change of pysche.The whole movie didn't change much from the source material, although from a general point of view, the movie would be better if the plot had more suspense to it.

As a result, a lot of what happens in terms of plot points, themes, story, and actions that happen are either ridiculous, impossible, or spoonfed to you.This isnt to imply this movie is bad, just to say, its not made to be some award winning piece of fiction that changes the landscape of women in films. Its an enjoyable fictional tale of the sister of sherlock holmes. This fictional tale basically considered ""What is Sherlock has a tween sister that was just as clever and interesting as her, but had to deal also with being a woman during the time where woman were meant to be seen and not heard"". Its basically a Nancy Drew story set in the Sherlock mythos.The story is overall fun and enjoyable. The cast they picked did the show justice, the story is somewhat moving, and somewhat interesting, and the character of Elona Holmes in an interesting one. Its a nice 2 hrs watch, with this over looming mystery of 'The Mother of Sherlock Holmes"".There are a couple of problems I have with the film. While I didnt expect it to be beyound exceptional, there were bits that really annoyed me. The 4th wall breaking is supposed to add something to the story. Maybe give the audience a look into the head of Elona, or maybe point out something that Elona noticed that we would overlook. What they use the 4th Wall Breaks for mainly is to spoonfeed the audience the thoughts, feelings, and story. As though the audience wasnt intelligent enough to understand whats going on, they had 4th wall breaks to constantly catch you up. And the story of the mother is built up heavily for roughly half the movie, only to somewhat abandon the reason they were building the story of the mother up. What they should have done was to build the mother's story a mystery the audience could look forward to in a future film. While this is still a possibility, there isnt any real desire or cliff hanger feeling to the mothers story.Overall, its an enjoyable piece of fiction. But potential of an ongoing mystery series seems to already have been abandon. No lead into possible other films or possible other stories is even hinted at. The film plays out like a ""I'm Elona Holmes, this is my story, and thats it. Thank you for listening"".""",8

I think he is very much the actor that you cast for a character you want the audience to fall in love with an root for.I also found Enola's relationship with the boy(whose name I'm not going to even try to spell) to be very familiar. After thinking about it for a little I realized it was the same relationship as Jo and Laurie from the book(which was later made into two films) Little Women.The thing I really didn't like about this film though is the four dimension effect. It very much reminded me of when I was a little kid and I was watching Dora and she asked me where the bad guy was. I think the film as a whole was fantastic. But this really killed it for me. The movie is Rated PG-13 it is not made for children, and I honestly find it kind of degrading to the audience. I personally didn't enjoy it as it seems others have.

Sadly it tries really really sloppily to be a feminist flick ...
I usually love Sherlock Holmes movies because they, unlike most Hollywood movies, respect the audience and doesn't treat them as if they can't wrap their head around complex things or as if they will swallow any nonsense without an explanation. This movie is not that... but it very easily could have been, even while keeping it's light charm. This segways back to my point about the feminist component about the movie. About a third ways in the movie seems perfectly willing to sacrifice cleverness to really hammer home that 'This is a feminist movie guys!!', please believe me! It will go out of its way to explain the viewer what is happening, even though what is happening is simple enough for Any Teenager to understand. At the same time the movie expects us to ignore and forget for example (SPOILERS) that the assassin was blown to bits, and that Enola's mom was going to commit a terrorist act!
It is also another feminist movie with a strong independent female protagonist who falls in love with literally the first boy she meets for no real reason, Wonder Woman style.
The movie is busy telling me how strong, independent and intelligent Enola is, yet it constantly interrupts her when she is about SHOW it, which is something I'd much rather have.
A lesson id like for movies to learn is that, if a character is being; independent or strong or insert trait, people watching can see it! So when the movie goes out of its way to tell us, it takes AWAY from the character...Anyway, I'm gonna cut my rant short here. In short, I'm disappointed at the wasted potential here.

Going into the movie, I thought I might be annoyed-based on the embellished trailer. But the movie was like a better, more evolved version of the trailer.

siderite,"""Disjointed, but with great potential""",24 September 2020,"""The biggest problem with Enola Holmes is that neither her nor the writers of the film knew what they wanted her to be. Yes, it's one of those films created especially to be feminist, but it is also fun. Yes, Enola is a Holmes, but she is her own woman - this is not a gender swap film, but rather a story about a fictional sister of Sherlock. Yes, the mysteries she has to solve and the final twist are kind of lame and even so she doesn't quite get it, but that's all in the plan: she is but a child, not a replacement for adult Holmes. And yes, it features Henry Cavill, but for no other reason that he brings in an audience, as his role is arguably the smallest of the entire movie, if you discount that of Helena Bonham Carter, who is also cast for audience fishing purposes.Many will be put off by the feminist agenda dumped expositionally in the first 20 minutes of the show and other will be put off by the middle part of the show which pretty much cancels those first 20 minutes. But the worst sin of the movie is that is a disjointed mess. Millie Bobby Brown is perfect for the role, but she jumps from fourth wall breaking exposition to dangerous situations, then joking, then someone deciding her life for her or trying to kill her, then young love, then solving mysteries, then finding her lost mother then putting England on progressive path and all without a real plan. She solves ridiculously easy anagrams and calls them cyphers, she stumbles upon things that have little bearing to the story, while the villains keep stumbling upon her from sheer coincidence. The story just happens to the characters and very little of what they do is actually of any consequence.Bottom line: a combination of a children movie with a feminist story while tangentially referencing Sherlock Holmes played by Henry Cavill to bring audiences in. Well acted and directed, but the story is puerile.""",7
Rovy13,"""Good not great.""",24 September 2020,"""Millie Bobby Brown was amazing. Her cheerful acting as free, curious and witty teenager was marvelous. And specifically breaking the fourth wall scenes are the ones that I enjoyed most.
Helena Bonham Carter as in the role of mother was very inspiring. Truly mothers like Eudoria Holmes is the kind of role model every daughter needs despite every generation.
Now to talk about the elephant in the room, the Holmes brothers, none of them met any expectations.Henry Cavill in the role of Sherlock acted as the typical charming wise-mind detective he is where in this specific movie the more brotherly side of his was needed to be shown. nd Mycroft was a total disaster.Sam Clafin did not suit the role at all. Mycroft is suppose to be more calm, rational and wiser than Sherlock. But in this movie he was shown as a hot headed, cynical guy. Neither the book or the series character was reflected upon the movie role which was a big disappointed for me.The story was good so far. It showed feminism its own way. Except the Holmes brothers short comings this movie is a good piece.""",8
manveshgill,"""A new approach to our favorite characters""",24 September 2020,"""I know this movie revolves around enola holmes and it has quite some witty scenes,breaking thr fourth wall was unique but if you are a strong reader of Sherlock books you will notice quite the difference in our favorite characters Sherlock and mycroft both but knowing that movie focuses on enola we can keep that aside but still from my perspective movie had a lot of untapped potential and could have done better with portraying the characters.""",6
markbarner,"""Well played""",24 September 2020,"""It always pleases me to watch a well written story. Although it was a bit predictable it had many good moments due to the lead role as she is so very talented. Sometimes there was a bit overacting or let's call it a little too much child-action when it was overly dramatic for no reason.
I was very entertained and I loved how the story unfolded but the where some corrections to be made if you ask me.The scene where she fights the killer for the first time, she was almost waiting and being extra slow in the whole scene and he could have killed her many times realistically. Also he stabs her and they both very veeeery slowly just stands there.
We never see or hear the story or at least sees some scars on the killers face after the explosion.
When she fails at fighting him she takes long breaks where as if her mother taught her that she should be quick and no that hesitant.The scene where she and the boy runs from mycrafts detective and barricades themselves in the room makes no sense as she doesn't fight him to avoid being caught. She herself could at least tried to escape or gotten revenge on the woman that ratted on her. Makes no sense to give herself up.
Also shortly after she gives mycroft all her money instead of just keeping a little bit herself. Or not just cry when he yells at her.At the school she doesn't try to escape earlier. Makes me puzzle like she wanted to stay.When she finds the boy in the flower market it's not like they are trying to hide or run even though they talk about being in great danger. Puzzles me.When they steal the car our lead role yells the boy in his face about why they should go to his estate and examine the situation. While she yells it turns into a very odd scene as she looks at him for a very very long time!?When they examine the boys estate they drive there in a noisy car parking it close and the later say ""they know we are here""... how would they know first of all that you would arrive by car!!!?When the boy is shot she literally waits until the grandmother shoots her!! Why!? No running from an old woman. They had all the time in the world. The boy had no chance of knowing if the grandmother would shoot him in the face or legs or so or if she would miss... makes no sense that he care free let's her shoot him! Just bad direction as many other times.There where a few more moments that just got me out of the movie cringing over how a scene failed. But with the lead roles and the quality of acting and the well spoken dialects it pulled me in again. Luckily.I would wish that Scherlock Holmes would have been a more interesting character. He was very silent and boring the entire movie. Not as smart as he was supposed to be. The fact that he was so slow kinda made it nonsense that he would be this famous in the movie. Just felt off to silence the role and not make a bigger character out of him. A character to look up to or to at least have weirded us out a bit. But no.All in all I enjoyed it though cursing at some scenes didn't help haha.""",6

It is a well crafted young adult film that teen girl will love.
A little overacted by MBB but clever script
Carville is adequate
It catches Nineteenth century class war.""",6
