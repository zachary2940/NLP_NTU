hailgenghiskhan,"""A cult feminist movie""",1 October 2020,"""A pure fiction with no genius minded teen girl( I mean not that much intelligent as rdj Sherlock Holmes..) story runs with a feminist tone...where man is called useless even though so many inventions are made by them and even small boys are also called useless unnecessarily...belive me this film is only for feminists... not for true Sherlock fans and not for genuine humans. finally this movie is not worth of your time.Remember time is not just a concept but it represents your life span.""",1
libertysanders,"""Don't waste your time.""",1 October 2020,"""If there's one thing that consistently annoys me it is meddling with established historical literary characters. The casting for the characters of Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes is a train wreck, both in terms of their physical traits and their personalities. For those actually familiar with these characters no explanation is necessary. For everyone else to do so is pointless. The shame of it is that this rendition could have been filmed with the characters intact. If there are more productions in this franchise I will NOT be watching them.""",1
ganzierozzi,"""Utter crap and the most annoying acrtress of her generation""",29 September 2020,"""The algorithm era strikes again: ""oh, ok, stranger things Is our most rated show, the witcher Is the most rated of the last eight months(and this Is probably bad for a streaming platform that put out contents every week). So, put the two actors in a movie, obviously with some approx. sprayed feminism, cause Is the winning spot in this times. Ok. The plot? The characters? The directing? Oh nevermind, the target of this stuff doesn't need that. They only Need something to put in some ig story, with some snob and catchy sentence""""",1
desdeelfondodelabismo,"""Disappointing""",25 September 2020,"""I only saw about 30 minutes of the movie because i got very bored. In those 30 minutes none of the characters acted in a intelligent way, and being the Holmes family, that's disappointing.Especially Enola. She's supposed to be very intelligent, but she required the help of scrabble letters chips to read an ""encrypted code"" that resulted to be only a backward written sentence that could be easily seen at first sight.""",2
wolfnet-56595,"""Story from alternative universe, apparently""",27 September 2020,"""Since I know enough about history I could not watch it till the end. Such... Ignorance and disrespect to history. Why they even needed Holmes? Only to be able to sell it. Nobody would be interested about that movie if they would not used name of Doyle's character. Ehhh... World need good movies and not another stupid feminist propaganda movie. And worst is they are not even trying to hide it. Men are weak, incompetent while Enola does jiujitsu, understand how to make bombs... And when she interacts with that boy he is opressed by her like useless servant... Damn, I am so happy I remember time when movies was about stories and not stupid propaganda...""",2
tomt-97339,"""No! Dont do it to yourself...""",23 September 2020,"""Waste of time movie that seems to be made as it goes so you wont be able to describe what was is about when it ends.
Lots of wtf scenes, bad dialogues and annoying monologues when Enola talking to camera or to her self,....
Not a film critic here but better rewatch any old movie you liked the this - time would be better invested. However maybe some 10 years old girl can find Enola as her future idol, but I wouldnt bet on that. Sorry ðŸ˜•""",2
sharnelperera,"""Snooze fest""",26 September 2020,"""I was so excited to watch this, being a big fan of the older Sherlock Holmes films, but this was honestly nothing more than a snooze fest. The cast was impressive however the storyline was incredibly boring. You'd think a film revolving around the mystery disappearance of Sherlock Holmes (and therefore Enola Holmes's) mother would be somewhat exciting.... but it isn't. Probably the most infuriating thing about the film is Enola herself where she insists on speaking directly to us, the audience. Yes, we get it, you're a young and curious girl about to go on an 'adventure'. Just shut up and get on with it will you?! Sadly, the 'adventure' just never eventuates until maybe the last 10 minutes or so where there is a brief and extremely boring moment where Enola and her love interest are being shot at. But neither is seriously injured ofcourse. Throughout the film, the so called 'puzzle' regarding Enola's mother's disappearance unravels excruciating slowly and with seemingly very little effort or any real detective work. About a quarter of the way into this film, I was looking at the clock wondering when it will end and debating whether or not I should just switch it off early. I persevered on the silly notion that perhaps it will get better. Unfortunately, it didn't.""",3
pskurrie,"""Missing the Point""",26 September 2020,"""Reviewers who are mentioning a 'refreshing take' are actually missing the point of the negative reviews. They've taken existing IP and changed the context, changed the core characters and embedded 21st Century themes into it. Don't come back as it's a 're-imagining' and is 'updating' - no, the time period setting should be true to the story. Did they have modern cars? Why not?
Those suggesting about Harry Potter.....what if Potter was re-imagined as a black farm boy with no magic powers and no Hogwarts? Would it be considered inaccurate?
Holmes, much like Bond, is a set world, set characters who act specific ways.
By all means create a female centric version, but don't use the Holmes name.
Interesting that the original writers estate is currently suing this film for misrepresenting it's core characters. Elona Holmes was written in 2008 by a writer piggy-backing off a known brand. Really lazy. Sums up this generation.""",3
aarongnr,"""Utter garbage""",27 September 2020,"""I can't say there is anything good about this movie. The acting is terrible, the script is badly written and the story is your typical female empowerment, just... without the empowerment? The female empowerment in this movie is basically a mother not giving her daughter a proper education because that's a somehow a curveball to society.And it's not smart either. Most of ""riddles"" in this are just wordplay which any 10y/o could solve with some time. Enola is a quick thinker and can solve it quicker, but that doesn't make the riddles any less boring.Don't waste your time on this. Millie Bobbie Brown is anything but a great actress (yet?).""",3
floradora,"""Subtle As A Brick""",28 September 2020,"""Another film that seeks to ""educate"" viewers and is rather heavy-handed about it. Women's rights, girl power, finding and embracing oneself, the brutality of misogyny and racism, a telegraphed ending... as Bill the Cat would say, ""ACK!"" There are so many cuts in every scene, the director must think viewers have the attention spans of gnats. Though the premise might have been clever, a very dissatisfying film altogether.""",4
sharpe-69738,"""Millie is great - the movie itself notsomuch.""",28 September 2020,"""Millie Bobby Brown is an amazing young actress with a bright future ahead of her. That said, this story is a mess and basically serves as a launch platform for Millie's career and little else.Towards the end it devolves into a plot-less hodge podge about something or other, then slams the viewer with a bunch of feminist talking points and then hides behind them, daring the viewer to criticise the cinematographic merits of the movie lest they be called out for being anti-feminist Conservative MAGA types.Well, I'm not buying it.Creating strong female leads is fine and dandy if you have a story that supports it organically - and that isn't new at all. Just look at Alien and others before and after it. Look at The Expanse TV show and even Millies' own Stranger Things. They all feature strong female leads, but the plots accommodate them naturally. Lately many movies seem to feel like the strong female lead has been shoehorned into the plot and that feels forced accordingly. In this case however, while the plot was written with a female lead in mind - the story itself was forced and all over the place and then it took a cheap political shot to try and hide that fact at the end.There were a few laughs though, to give it some credit - but little else.Basically it is aimed at young teenage girls.""",4
sachin-jhunjhun,"""A big mess!""",27 September 2020,"""Young girl dresses as boy and runs from home. She meets a boy who also has run from home. Then she loses boy and dresses as girl to find her mom who also has run from home. She loses interest in finding mom and decides to find boy which she does in a minute (Sherlock sister.. duh!) then they start running away from whoever is trying to find them! I could go on and on...jujitsu 300 years back.. black females running cafes during that period.. this movie is one gigantic mess! I have insomnia and slept like twice during the viewing and eventually couldn't finish the movie. Love Milly Bobby brown but this movie is crap... stay away!""",4
benjamingobey,"""Disrespectful, childish and irresponsible.""",4 October 2020,"""Please note Sherlock Holmes, Mycroft Holmes, and Inspector Lestrade are all characters created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and in no shape or form has he been credited in this film which is diabolical.The film was good. Sam Claflin portrayal of Mycroft Holmes was almost spot on but a bit to monstrous. The writers were trying to make him more a villain than 2nd supporting role.Henry Cavill's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes was ok, but he did not really put much work into it, he did not research the character and that is why it was not perfect.But in his defence this story is by another author not by Conan Doyle and Henry Cavill was just doing his job maybe he just wasn't directed right.They also fail to tell us the timeline of the film. It shows a flashback of Enola being born and says 1884 in writing, but there is an automobile in the film and Enola is 16 so the year must be 1900?They also mentioned a few times Holmes always works alone and Watson is not referenced at all.If it was set in 1884 that means Holmes has known Watson for three years because they met in 1881 in 'A Study in Scarlet' but if it was set in 1900 that means Holmes has known Watson for 19 years and it's also been 5 years since he faked his death.It was disrespectful what they did with the illustrations by making fun of them and doing a childish sketch, they should respect Sidney Pagets' work.Millie Bobby Brown did well as Enola Holmes and was a strong female lead but there were few scenes cut to next where she seem to not be focusing on here acting and from some of the behind the scenes footage I've seen she was very childish on set, in good way which is great to have fun with your co stars but it's still good to be professional.Sam Claflin was the same apparently but Henry Cavill was always focused on his acting straight away when they said action and the cameras starting rolling.Burn Gorman was a great villain I thought he might of been Professor Moriarty before the trailer hit.The trouble these days is they get the most famous actors to play the roles it's very much like what Christopher Nolan said in a documentary about 'The Dark Knight Trilogy' he didn't wanna get the most famous actors he wanted to get the best actors.This is what you gonna do with Sherlock Holmes, don't get the most famous get the best actors to play the roles.""",5
ndeschweinitz,"""An ok film, but all over the place.""",4 October 2020,"""I ended this movie feeling unsatisfied. Here are a few things I noticed.
Pros:
In my opinion, the production design was the best part of the movie and the 18th century London look was great. Everything looks good.The A-list castSome of the action sequences were well shotCons:
The plot is all over the place. It starts as a mystery to find the mother, then rebelling against the stereotypical jerk brother, than romance with some boy and a dude trying to kill them.Annoying feminism messages thrown in your face the entire movieEnola doesn't have a clear motivation, thanks to the muddled plotThe ending is not climactic and the missing mother subplot is resolved in the most boring wayThe film overstays it's welcome, runtime is too long""",5
sinahaase-960-743497,"""So much potential yes so disappointed.""",23 September 2020,"""I had such high hopes for this Netflix film. I didn't read the info really I just saw the trailer and for some reason I thought it was going to be a series and then I realized it was a film once it started but still in the beginning I was so eager to finish it thinking that it was going to be great! Sadly it is nothing comparable to any Sherlock versions I have seen. As a feminist myself I was actually intrigued to see where they were going to go with their storyline once it had come into place, but it was just so bad! There was no capturing component about her deductions as some type of female detective and they had every chance to make it that way hello? She is Sherlocks sister and she's supposed to be smart and and witty because of her mothers teaching but it focus so much more on physical fighting rather than her intelligence in solving a mystery. Sherlocks character was ridiculous and he made me cringe I can't believe they chose him and his lies were so dumb And in no way add a Sherlock level more of just a normal detective. I'm pretty sure they just chose him because he is handsome which is really Innoway contradictory towards the feminist way my biggest complaint was the ending result the entire time she is looking for her mother right? In fact that was in the trailer and it is the main plot of the movie besides a boy that she randomly met and fell in love within 10 seconds.And yet she never solved the mystery of where her mother was her mother just appeared somehow knowing where she was in a random hotel room and was there to find her she did not find her mother and it was so disappointing as a film. There was so much potential having Millie Bobby Brown as the main character as well as other supporting roles including Helena Bonham Carter and yet it was a complete failure! Included in that level of potential I didn't think the feminist line was so bad. In fact I thought it had an awesome creative framework to put in a great film and like I keep saying I was very disappointed.""",5
swordsnare,"""The Enola Holmes Mysteries""",26 September 2020,"""Yes, there seems to be an apparent feminist message to this film. Once you get past some of these references, I found Millie Bobby Brown to be quite the competent and engaging young actress. As opposed to her usual role on Stranger Things, which is quite subdued in contrast.The production and costume design was good, but the storyline seemed a little detached from each of the characters involved. Henry Cavill as Sherlock was very much in the background of this film. I had wished there was more of a connection between Enola and Sherlock, other than the sharing of a surname.I'm not familiar with book series, but this film is probably more for the young adults in the end. It also seems pretty open-ended and will inevitably lead to a sequel?""",6
shakthi-82794,"""A clumsy film yet enjoyable""",25 September 2020,"""Enola Holmes is a family movie that's very enjoyable, with its respectable cast and their top notch acting. However, it's not a movie without its two major flaws:
Even though the little love story was sewed into the main plot, but I often found it taking huge chunks of the movie runtime. Their love story was arguably distracting and unnecessary for the movies main plot.Enola Holmes also falls short with their character development for character such as Sherlock Holmes and his brother. Even though the movie makes it clear that they have been maintaining a distance from their mother and sister, the story doesn't care to explain their reasons. I felt this might've have been a necessary plot to give the viewers a more understandable Enola HolmesHowever, if these two flaws doesn't not bother you as a viewer, this is very well an enjoyable and pleasant film.""",6
IdiotBox_Recommendations,"""A Mildly Entertaining.""",23 September 2020,"""Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes's younger sibling, Enola is raised by her enigmatic mother and trained in tennis, martial arts and physics. However one fine day Elona finds her mother missing, leaving behind a few clues. When Mycroft decides to enroll Elona in a lady grooming school, she makes a run to find her mother and gets involved in a case concerning a young lord. She goes about deciphering codes that ultimately lead to her mother.This movie is a bit too slow and fails to form a gripping plot. Being a detective movie, there was not much of a mystery to solve either. Just simple code breaking and something which comes mildly close to an adventure. The only good part was Milly Bobby Brown's charming acting skills and of course Helena Bonham Carter. Nothing much to see for Henry Cavill either. Watch this only if you have two hours to spare.""",6
totahalaa,"""8/10 what's up with all these negative reviews thank god I didn't listen to them""",24 September 2020,"""It was a very enjoyable movie with interesting adventure and a great message! They didn't spon on Sherlock or Mycrofts characters i agree but it wasn't about them it was about Enola Holmes and i love her she's absolutely wonderful I think millie brown did a wonderful job she was a treat to watch
lovely movie I personally hope for a sequel""",7
kennethbthomas,"""A Chick Flick Not Meeting The Sherlock Holmes Standards""",23 September 2020,"""The film is kinda underwhelming probably cuz I expected it to be within the 'Sherlock' standards. It has a very cliched story of someone who's on their path of self discovery, who ends up falling in love and the end. It might be probably cuz of the Sherlock series' and movies' influence on me but it's just pretty decent. Don't expect it to be a big mystery movie. I liked the actors playing their parts and even the cinematography for it gives us a visual treat but the story kind of lagged.
I'm a Henry Cavill fan and I think he just did a decent job as Sherlock even when I know that his acting is kind of limited. The other guy who plays Mycroft in the film also does a decent job. The main lead gave a decent performance but the story fell flat. It's probably because of the influence I have through SH movies & series. This is a one time watch movie with not so memorable moments/performances. I'm curious to see Henry in a full fledged Sherlock role maybe in a spin off.
I hope the sequel does justice if there's gonna be one.
I'll give the movie a 6/10 but an extra point for the sets and design.""",7
benmundie,"""Enjoyable but Nothing Special!""",15 October 2020,"""'Enola Holmes' is a fun adventure picture which is full of an empowering feminist message. The acting is fantastic with the standouts being Millie Bobby Brown as the titular character, Henry Cavill as 'Sherlock Holmes' and Sam Claflin as 'Mycroft Holmes'. The writing is endearing and suits the story they're telling and how they're portraying the legendary Sherlock Holmes. Henry Cavill brings something new to the role in the most recent adaption of the famous character. The story has obvious direction with Enola searching for her mother, Eudoria, (Helen Bonham Carter). With multiple twists involved which don't always land but do for the most part. The film paints a picture where Enola is the heroine, then convinces younger viewers that she doesn't need to be constrained by the rules of her family. The relationship between Enola and Tewksbury seems realistic and they bounce off each other well. However, the film isn't perfect, the comedy doesn't always land and seems quite forced at times. The emotional scenes, especially at the end between the main protagonist and her mother, lack logic and it feels like we missed a pivotal scene at the end. In the middle of the second act the story drags as they take Enola out of her quest to put her into a random side story. Some aspects of the world are incredibly unrealistic, in particular, when Linthorn (Burn Gorman) survives despite being in the centre of a massive explosion.
Overall, the acting really carries the film and Millie Bobby Brown is perfect in the role. This is an enjoyable flick for people that have a free two hours.""",7
schofy,"""Quaint""",24 September 2020,"""A nice film that plays merrily along. Millie brown is quite charming and the rest of the cast are all spot on. Henry cavill does very good earnest and sam Caflin is terrific and dark as the older holmes.
This is a film you could sit down with a family and watch. It's not paddington but I think netflix have aimed and got close.""",8
kyraonice0325,"""Unexpectedly Pleasing""",23 September 2020,"""I'll be honest: when I first heard about this film, I didn't think I would enjoy it. There was something about the trailer that just felt boring to me. However, excited to see Millie Bobby Brown in another role, I began watching with a fresh mind, and I was definitely pleasantly surprised: I enjoyed how it was feminist yet didn't overdo it and portrayed feminism in the most realising and heartfelt way. I also liked how it left opinions on various things open to the viewer. I especially admired how the male characters also had depth and development, which I often find lacking in films like this. Overall, I really enjoyed watching this and will probably be revisiting multiple times!""",8
Scar38,"""Very good!!""",24 September 2020,"""This isn't usually my type of film at all but I'm a big fan of the brilliant Henry Cavill so I gave it a shot, and it was really really good, I enjoyed it from start to finish.
I recently said Millie Bobby Brown couldn't act because I thought a film like Godzilla King Of The Monsters didn't suit her but I have been proved very wrong because she clearly can act, she was brilliant in this, I was very impressed, there was also a very good supporting cast.
This is a excellent little gem of a film.""",8
niressa-71723,"""Old and New""",16 October 2020,"""I found it intriguing. A different take on the Holmes family. A story told from the point of view of a girl becoming a woman fighting for the right to be her own person. Oddly enough aren't we still doing that today. Those who want things to remain old yet those who recognize that change can also be necessary. l loved the mysterious playful manner in which the story was told. I gave a 9 of 10 because I believe nothing is perfect otherwise we have nothing to strive for.""",9
sarmstrong-55715,"""Loved it!""",26 September 2020,"""This was a great movie to watch with your daughter. My 10 year old was on the edge of her seat and loved the movie. At one point she turned to me and said, ""I want to be Enola!""
That said, it may not be for diehard Sherlock Holmes fans who enjoy Doyle's style and characterization of Holmes. He's much kinder, empathetic and plays a protective big brother in the film - not in line with the original character. Enola breaks the fourth wall often and while that annoyed a lot of reviewers, it's when most of the comedy came through. I thought it was a cute addition and showed Enola's personality more.
All in all, if you're looking for a fun, exciting family movie - this is definitely it!""",9
faer_kr,"""Entertaining""",24 September 2020,"""An adventure film with hints of English drama.
It is about the adventure of a teenager who goes in search of her mother who has disappeared, escaping from her brothers.
Use the formula from the Holmes movies.
Predictable ending like all of its kind.
Entertaining
Quality.
Good effects and sequels of action, only two moments are not completely achieved.
Henry Cavill and Sam Claflin are spectacular, unfortunately their potential is not appreciated in the film. He doesn't even ask Robert Downey JR for anything.
The era masterfully achieved.
With light jokes and very organic and intelligent sarcasms.
The script is acceptable.
With feminist touches that give the era a wonderful touch.

That's for a chunkier role down the line..For this one, she gives just the right amount of everything to the character and the supporting cast are equally great.Production is brilliant and slick without being overdone.Story is appealing enough for adults and kids alike, I can see this becoming quite the perennial especially for young girls as it's a cute little love story, but falls short of the cheesier side thankfully.I'll definitely watch it again but for now, it's been a sweet, fun, charming lazy Saturday film that's been thoroughly enjoyable.Hope you enjoy it too""",10
